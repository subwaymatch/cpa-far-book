# Not-for-Profit Accounting Overview

Not-for-profit (NFP) organizations follow FASB guidance tailored to mission-driven activities. FAR candidates must understand finan
cial statement presentation, net asset classifications, and contribution accounting.

## Key Concepts

- **Net asset classifications:** Without donor restrictions and with donor restrictions.
- **Contribution accounting:** Recognize revenue when an unconditional pledge is received; distinguish contributions from exchange
  transactions.
- **Functional expense reporting:** Present expenses by both nature (salaries, rent) and function (program, management and general,
  fundraising).

Subsequent chapters provide journal entries, disclosure checklists, and practice examples for interpreting NFP financial statements
and contribution transactions on the FAR exam.
