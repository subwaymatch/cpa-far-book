# Not-for-Profit Accounting Overview

Not-for-profit (NFP) organizations follow FASB guidance tailored to their unique mission-driven activities. FAR candidates must understand financial statement presentation, net asset classifications, and accounting for contributions.

## Key Concepts

- **Net asset classifications:** Without donor restrictions and with donor restrictions.
- **Contribution accounting:** Recognize revenue when an unconditional pledge is received; distinguish between contributions and exchange transactions.
- **Functional expense reporting:** Present expenses by both nature (e.g., salaries) and function (program services, supporting services).

This section provides foundational knowledge for interpreting NFP financial statements and handling contribution transactions on the FAR exam.
