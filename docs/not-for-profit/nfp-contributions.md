# NFP Contributions

Contributions are a primary revenue source for not-for-profit organizations. FAR candidates must distinguish between contributions and exchange transactions, evaluate donor restrictions, and account for pledges and endowments under ASC 958.

## Contribution Recognition

- Recognize contribution revenue when the promise is **unconditional** and measurable.
- Conditional promises include donor-imposed barriers (e.g., matching requirements, measurable outcomes); recognize revenue when conditions are substantially met.
- Multiyear pledges are recorded at present value with accretion of the discount classified as contribution revenue.

## Donor Restrictions

- **With donor restrictions:** Funds restricted for specific purposes, time periods, or endowments. Release to without donor restrictions when purpose accomplished or time restriction expires.
- **Without donor restrictions:** Available for general operations; board designations are internal and do not create donor restrictions but should be disclosed.

## Donated Goods and Services

- Recognize donated services if they create or enhance nonfinancial assets or require specialized skills that would typically need to be purchased (e.g., legal services).
- Donated materials and collection items recognized at fair value when received.

## Endowments

- **True (permanent) endowment:** Donor stipulates principal must be maintained in perpetuity; investment returns may be restricted or unrestricted.
- **Term endowment:** Principal maintained for a period or until an event occurs.
- Follow UPMIFA guidance to determine prudent spending rate; classify net assets as with donor restrictions until appropriated for expenditure.

## Agency Transactions

- When an NFP receives assets on behalf of another organization, recognize a liability rather than contribution revenue (agency or intermediary transactions).

## Contributions of Long-Lived Assets

- Donor-restricted contributions for long-lived assets are typically reported as with donor restrictions until placed in service (reclassify upon satisfaction of purpose).

## Exam Tips

- Carefully identify donor-imposed conditions versus restrictions; conditions delay recognition, restrictions affect classification.
- Compute present value of pledges using appropriate discount rates and adjust for allowance for doubtful accounts.
- Understand journal entries for releases of restrictions and reclassification of net assets.

Accurate accounting for contributions ensures NFP financial statements reflect donor intent and resource availability.
