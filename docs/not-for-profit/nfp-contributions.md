# NFP Contributions

Contributions are a primary revenue source for not-for-profit organizations. FAR candidates must distinguish contributions from ex
change transactions, evaluate donor restrictions, and account for pledges and endowments under ASC 958.

## Contribution Recognition

- Recognize revenue when a promise is **unconditional** and measurable.
- Conditional promises include donor-imposed barriers (matching requirements, measurable outcomes); recognize revenue when conditi
ons are substantially met.
- Multiyear pledges are recorded at present value; accrete the discount as contribution revenue.

### Example: Multi-Year Pledge

Donor pledges $100,000 payable $50,000 now and $50,000 in one year; discount rate 4%.

```text
Present value of future payment = 50,000 / 1.04 = 48,077
Dr. Pledges receivable                      98,077
    Cr. Contribution revenue – with donor restrictions   98,077

Cash collected at pledge date:
Dr. Cash                                   50,000
    Cr. Pledges receivable                        50,000

Year-end accretion:
Dr. Pledges receivable                     1,923
    Cr. Contribution revenue – with donor restrictions   1,923
```

## Donor Restrictions

- **With donor restrictions:** Funds restricted for specific purposes, time periods, or endowments. Release when purpose accompli
shed or time passes.
- **Without donor restrictions:** Available for general operations; board designations do not create donor restrictions but must b
e disclosed.

### Release Example

Scholarship expenditures satisfy a $20,000 purpose restriction.

```text
Dr. Net assets with donor restrictions    20,000
    Cr. Net assets released from restrictions   20,000

Dr. Net assets released from restrictions 20,000
    Cr. Net assets without donor restrictions   20,000
```

## Donated Goods and Services

Recognize donated services if they create or enhance nonfinancial assets or require specialized skills.

```text
Professional legal services donated (fair value $8,500):
Dr. Legal expense          8,500
    Cr. Contribution revenue – without donor restrictions   8,500
```

## Endowments and UPMIFA

- **Permanent endowments:** Donor requires principal to remain intact; investment return may be restricted for specific uses.
- **Term endowments:** Principal maintained until a time or event occurs.
- Follow UPMIFA to determine prudent spending. Classification remains with donor restrictions until appropriated for expenditure.

```text
Endowment contribution received:
Dr. Cash                                 250,000
    Cr. Net assets with donor restrictions – endowment   250,000
```

## Agency Transactions

When receiving assets on behalf of another organization, record a liability instead of contribution revenue.

```text
Dr. Cash                  30,000
    Cr. Agency funds payable    30,000
```

## Contributions of Long-Lived Assets

- Donor-restricted contributions for long-lived assets are typically reported as with donor restrictions until the asset is placed
 in service.

```text
Donation of equipment restricted for program use:
Dr. Equipment                      45,000
    Cr. Contribution revenue – with donor restrictions   45,000

Upon placing in service:
Dr. Net assets with donor restrictions    45,000
    Cr. Net assets without donor restrictions   45,000
```

Accurate contribution accounting ensures NFP statements reflect donor intent and resource availability—skills frequently tested on
 FAR simulations.
