# NFP Financial Statements

Not-for-profit organizations present a set of financial statements tailored to donor and regulatory needs under ASC 958.

## Required Statements

1. **Statement of Financial Position:** Presents assets, liabilities, and net assets with and without donor restrictions.
2. **Statement of Activities:** Reports changes in net assets, including contributions, program revenues, investment gains/losses, and releases of restrictions.
3. **Statement of Cash Flows:** Prepared using the direct or indirect method; investing and financing classifications follow GAAP with additional categories for restricted contributions.
4. **Statement of Functional Expenses:** Required for voluntary health and welfare organizations; most NFPs provide a matrix of expenses by function and nature.

## Net Asset Classifications

- **Without donor restrictions:** Resources available for general use or subject to board designations (disclosed but not a separate net asset class).
- **With donor restrictions:** Subject to donor-imposed stipulations that may be temporary (time/purpose) or perpetual (endowments). Releases occur when conditions are met or time passes.

## Revenue Recognition

- **Contributions:** Recognize when unconditional; classify as donor-restricted if stipulations exist.
- **Conditional promises:** Recognize revenue when barriers are overcome (e.g., achieving a matching requirement).
- **Exchange transactions:** Apply ASC 606 if both parties receive commensurate value.

## Functional Expenses

- Categorize expenses into program services and supporting services (management and general, fundraising).
- Allocate costs based on cause-and-effect relationships or rational allocation (e.g., rent by square footage).

## Disclosures

1. Qualitative and quantitative information about liquidity and availability of resources.
2. Methods used to allocate costs among functions.
3. Composition of net assets with donor restrictions, including time and purpose restrictions and endowment information.
4. Rollforward of endowment funds with interpretation of the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA).

Understanding NFP financial statements enables you to analyze mission-driven organizations and respond to FAR questions requiring classification of contributions and expenses.
