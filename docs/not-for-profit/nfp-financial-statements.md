# NFP Financial Statements

Not-for-profit organizations present financial statements tailored to donor and regulatory needs under ASC 958.

## Required Statements

1. **Statement of Financial Position:** Assets, liabilities, and net assets with and without donor restrictions.
2. **Statement of Activities:** Changes in net assets, including contributions, program revenues, investment gains/losses, and rel
 eases of restrictions.
3. **Statement of Cash Flows:** Prepared using direct or indirect method; classify contributions restricted for long-term purposes
 as financing inflows.
4. **Statement of Functional Expenses:** Required for voluntary health and welfare organizations; widely presented by others in a
 matrix of natural and functional classification.

## Net Asset Classifications

- **Without donor restrictions:** Available for general use or subject to board designations.
- **With donor restrictions:** Subject to donor stipulations (time/purpose or perpetual endowment). Release restrictions when the c
onditions are met or time passes.

- Allocate shared costs using rational methods (square footage for occupancy, time records for salaries).
