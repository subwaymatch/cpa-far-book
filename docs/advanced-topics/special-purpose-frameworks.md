# Special Purpose Frameworks

Special purpose frameworks (SPFs), also known as other comprehensive bases of accounting (OCBOA), provide alternatives to GAAP for nonissuers. FAR candidates should recognize when SPFs are appropriate and how financial statements differ from GAAP presentation.

## Common Frameworks

- **Cash basis:** Recognizes transactions when cash is received or paid. Simple but omits receivables, payables, and accruals.
- **Modified cash basis:** Begins with cash basis but includes selected accrual adjustments (e.g., capitalizing long-term assets, accruing taxes payable).
- **Tax basis:** Mirrors income tax reporting rules; useful for entities whose users focus on taxable income.
- **Regulatory basis:** Required by governmental or industry regulators (e.g., insurance statutory accounting).
- **Contractual basis:** Developed to comply with agreements, such as lender requirements.

## Presentation Considerations

- Financial statements must describe the framework used and include clear titles (e.g., "Statement of Assets and Liabilities—Tax Basis").
- Provide summary of significant accounting policies explaining departures from GAAP.
- Disclose that the framework may not be suitable for other purposes.

## Converting from SPF to GAAP

- Adjust to recognize accruals, deferred taxes, and fair value measurements absent under the SPF.
- Reclassify statements to GAAP terminology (e.g., balance sheet, income statement).

## Auditor Considerations

- Auditors issue opinions on SPF financial statements referencing the framework and include emphasis-of-matter paragraphs.
- Evaluate whether the SPF is acceptable given intended users and needs.

## Exam Tips

- Identify which framework is used based on transaction descriptions.
- Understand how to reconcile tax basis income to GAAP (Schedule M-1 concepts).
- Recognize disclosure requirements emphasizing the framework’s limitations.

Awareness of special purpose frameworks prepares you to address exam questions involving non-GAAP financial statements and reporting alternatives for private entities.
