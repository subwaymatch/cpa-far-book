# Special Purpose Frameworks

Special purpose frameworks (SPFs), also known as other comprehensive bases of accounting (OCBOA), provide alternatives to GAAP fo
r nonissuers. FAR candidates should recognize when SPFs are appropriate and how the statements differ from GAAP presentation.

## Common Frameworks

- **Cash basis:** Recognizes transactions when cash is received or paid; omits receivables, payables, and accruals.
- **Modified cash basis:** Starts with cash basis but incorporates selected accruals such as capitalizing long-term assets and acc
ruing payroll taxes.
- **Tax basis:** Mirrors income tax reporting rules; aligns with taxable income and Schedule M adjustments.
- **Regulatory basis:** Required by regulators (e.g., insurance statutory statements, bank call reports).
- **Contractual basis:** Tailored to lender agreements or internal covenants.

## Presentation Considerations

- Title statements clearly (e.g., “Statement of Assets and Liabilities—Income Tax Basis”).
- Include a summary of significant accounting policies describing departures from GAAP.
- Disclose that the financial statements may not be suitable for other purposes.

## Illustrative Adjustments

| Scenario | Cash Basis Entry | Tax Basis/Modified Cash Adjustment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accrued payroll taxes | None recorded until paid | `Dr. Payroll tax expense 9,000 / Cr. Payroll taxes payable 9,000` |
| Capitalizing equipment | Entire payment expensed | `Dr. Equipment 45,000 / Cr. Cash 45,000` and `Dr. Depreciation expense 4,500 / Cr. Accumulated depreciation 4,500` |
| Deferred revenue | Revenue recognized when cash received | `Dr. Cash 30,000 / Cr. Deferred revenue 30,000` (recognized when earned) |

## Converting SPF to GAAP

- Recognize receivables, payables, and accruals omitted under cash or tax basis.
- Record deferred taxes for timing differences between tax and GAAP income.
- Reclassify statements using GAAP terminology (balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows).

## Auditor Considerations

- Audit reports reference the SPF and include an emphasis-of-matter paragraph describing the framework.
- Auditors assess whether the framework is appropriate for intended users and whether disclosures are adequate.

## Exam Tips

- Identify the framework from narrative descriptions in simulations and adjust journal entries accordingly.
- Be prepared to reconcile tax basis income to GAAP income by tracking permanent versus temporary differences.
- Remember that GAAP-to-SPF conversion often focuses on removing accruals, while SPF-to-GAAP conversion adds them back.

Understanding special purpose frameworks prepares you to address exam questions involving non-GAAP financial statements and priva
te-company reporting alternatives.
