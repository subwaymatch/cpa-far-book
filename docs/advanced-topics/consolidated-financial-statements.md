# Consolidated Financial Statements

Consolidated financial statements present the results of a parent and its subsidiaries as a single economic entity. FAR candidates must understand control thresholds, consolidation procedures, intercompany eliminations, and noncontrolling interests under ASC 810.

## When to Consolidate

- Consolidation required when a parent has a **controlling financial interest** in another entity, typically through ownership of more than 50% of voting stock.
- Variable interest entities (VIEs) require consolidation by the primary beneficiary—the party with both power to direct activities and obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits.

## Consolidation Process

1. **Prepare separate financial statements** for parent and subsidiary using consistent accounting policies.
2. **Eliminate intercompany balances and transactions** (receivables/payables, sales/COGS, interest, dividends).
3. **Adjust subsidiary assets and liabilities** to fair value at acquisition date; recognize goodwill or gain on bargain purchase.
4. **Compute noncontrolling interest (NCI):** Share of subsidiary net assets not owned by parent.
5. **Combine like accounts** to produce consolidated statements.

## Acquisition Accounting

- Measure consideration transferred at fair value, including contingent consideration.
- Recognize identifiable assets and liabilities at fair value; record intangible assets separately when identifiable.
- Goodwill equals excess of consideration plus NCI and fair value of any previously held interest over fair value of net identifiable assets.

## Intercompany Transactions

- **Inventory sales:** Eliminate intercompany profit from ending inventory; adjust COGS when inventory sold to outsiders.
- **Fixed asset transfers:** Remove intercompany gains/losses and adjust depreciation to original cost basis.
- **Intercompany debt:** Eliminate reciprocal interest income/expense and loan balances.

## Noncontrolling Interest Reporting

- Present NCI in equity section of balance sheet.
- Attribute net income and comprehensive income to controlling and noncontrolling interests.

## Step Acquisitions and Partial Disposals

- Revalue previously held equity interests to fair value with gain/loss in earnings upon obtaining control.
- Partial disposals without loss of control adjust NCI and equity; loss of control triggers gain/loss recognition and deconsolidation.

## Disclosure Requirements

1. Composition of NCI and effects on equity.
2. Restrictions on transferring funds to parent.
3. Summarized financial information for significant subsidiaries and VIEs.

Consolidation problems integrate measurement, elimination entries, and presentation—practice with comprehensive workpaper examples to build speed and accuracy.
