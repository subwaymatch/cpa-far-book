# Consolidated Financial Statements

Consolidated financial statements present the results of a parent and its subsidiaries as a single economic entity. FAR candidate
s must understand control thresholds, consolidation procedures, intercompany eliminations, and noncontrolling interests under ASC
 810.

## When to Consolidate

- Consolidate when a parent has a controlling financial interest, generally >50% voting interest or as the primary beneficiary o
f a variable interest entity (VIE).
- Do not consolidate when control is temporary or the subsidiary is in legal reorganization under court supervision.

## Consolidation Workpaper Steps

1. Prepare separate financial statements for parent and subsidiary using consistent accounting policies.
2. Eliminate intercompany balances and transactions (receivables/payables, sales/COGS, interest, dividends).
3. Adjust subsidiary assets and liabilities to fair value at acquisition date; recognize goodwill or bargain purchase gain.
4. Compute noncontrolling interest (NCI) at fair value and allocate subsidiary income between controlling and noncontrolling owner
s.
5. Combine like accounts to produce consolidated statements.

### Example: Acquisition and Elimination Entries

Parent acquires 80% of Sub for $400,000 when Sub’s fair value of net identifiable assets is $450,000 (book value $360,000). The N
CI fair value is $95,000.

- Goodwill = Consideration $400,000 + NCI $95,000 − FV net assets $450,000 = $45,000.

Workpaper entries at acquisition:

S Entry – eliminate subsidiary equity:
Dr. Common stock – Sub            200,000
Dr. Retained earnings – Sub       160,000
    Cr. Investment in Sub                   320,000
    Cr. Noncontrolling interest              40,000

A Entry – record fair value adjustments and goodwill:
Dr. Inventory                     15,000
Dr. PP&E                          35,000
Dr. Goodwill                      45,000
    Cr. Noncontrolling interest              12,000
    Cr. Investment in Sub                   83,000
```

(Amounts allocate fair value adjustments 20% to NCI.)

### Intercompany Sales Example

Parent sells inventory costing $50,000 to Sub for $70,000; 40% remains unsold at year end.

```text
E Entry – eliminate intercompany profit:
Dr. Sales                         70,000
    Cr. Cost of goods sold                70,000

Dr. Cost of goods sold            8,000
    Cr. Inventory                          8,000
```

Profit eliminated = $20,000 × 40% = $8,000. When inventory is later sold externally, reverse the deferred profit.

### Intercompany Interest Example

Parent lends $300,000 to Sub at 5% interest.

```text
Elimination entry:
Dr. Interest revenue     15,000
    Cr. Interest expense       15,000
Dr. Notes payable – intercompany   300,000
    Cr. Notes receivable – intercompany 300,000
```

## Noncontrolling Interest Reporting

- Present NCI in equity on the consolidated balance sheet.
- Allocate net income and OCI between controlling and NCI in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income.

## Step Acquisitions and Partial Disposals

- Revalue previously held equity interests to fair value when obtaining control; record gain or loss in earnings.
- Partial disposals without loss of control adjust equity and NCI. Loss of control triggers recognition of gain/loss and deconsoli
dation of the subsidiary.

## Disclosure Checklist

1. Composition of NCI and effects on equity.
2. Restrictions on transferring assets or paying dividends to the parent.
3. Summarized financial information for significant subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs.

Practicing comprehensive consolidation workpapers builds speed with elimination entries, goodwill calculations, and NCI allocatio
ns commonly tested on FAR simulations.
