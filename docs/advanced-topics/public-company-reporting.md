# Public Company Reporting

Public companies in the United States must comply with SEC reporting requirements in addition to GAAP. FAR candidates should understand the structure of SEC filings, key regulations, and unique reporting considerations.

## Key SEC Filings

- **Form 10-K:** Annual report including audited financial statements, MD&A, risk factors, and internal control disclosures. Filed within 60–90 days after fiscal year-end depending on filer status.
- **Form 10-Q:** Quarterly report with interim financial statements (reviewed, not audited), MD&A updates, and disclosures of material changes. Filed within 40–45 days.
- **Form 8-K:** Current report for significant events (e.g., acquisitions, disposals, auditor changes) filed within four business days.
- **Proxy statements (DEF 14A):** Provide information for shareholder meetings, including executive compensation.

## Regulation S-X and S-K

- **Regulation S-X** governs form and content of financial statements, including schedules and supplementary information.
- **Regulation S-K** addresses nonfinancial statement disclosures such as MD&A, market risk, and corporate governance.

## MD&A Highlights

- Discuss results of operations, liquidity, capital resources, and critical accounting estimates.
- Provide known trends and uncertainties that could affect future performance.

## XBRL and Inline XBRL

- Companies must tag financial statements and footnotes using the US GAAP Financial Reporting Taxonomy.
- Inline XBRL allows embedding tags within HTML filings for improved transparency.

## Internal Control Reporting

- Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires management to assess internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) and, for accelerated filers, auditor attestation.
- Disclose material weaknesses and remediation plans.

## Earnings Releases and Non-GAAP Measures

- Non-GAAP metrics must be reconciled to GAAP results and presented with equal or greater prominence of GAAP measures.
- Regulation G applies to public disclosures including press releases and investor presentations.

## Exam Tips

- Know filing deadlines and the difference between large accelerated, accelerated, and nonaccelerated filers.
- Understand requirements for interim reporting (Regulation S-X Article 10) including disclosures of significant events and changes in accounting principles.
- Be able to identify which SEC forms report specific events or transactions.

Public company reporting questions emphasize regulatory compliance, disclosure, and presentation of financial information in SEC filings.
