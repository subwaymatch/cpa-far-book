# Public Company Reporting

Public companies in the United States must comply with SEC reporting requirements in addition to GAAP. FAR candidates should unde
rstand the structure of SEC filings, key regulations, and unique reporting considerations.

## Key SEC Filings and Deadlines

| Filing | Purpose | Deadline (Large Accelerated / Accelerated / Nonaccelerated) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Form 10-K | Annual report with audited financial statements, MD&A, and ICFR disclosures | 60 / 75 / 90 days after year-end |
| Form 10-Q | Quarterly update with reviewed statements and MD&A | 40 / 40 / 45 days after quarter-end |
| Form 8-K | Current report for significant events (acquisitions, auditor changes, bankruptcies) | Within 4 business days |
| Form S-1/S-3 | Registration statements for securities offerings | Prior to offering effectiveness |
| Proxy Statement (DEF 14A) | Shareholder meeting information, executive compensation | Filed before annual meeting |

## Regulation S-X and S-K Highlights

- **Regulation S-X:** Governs the form and content of financial statements, schedules, and pro forma information (Articles 3, 10,
and 11).
- **Regulation S-K:** Addresses nonfinancial disclosures such as MD&A, market risk, and corporate governance.
- **Article 11 pro forma statements:** Required for significant business combinations; adjust historical financials for transacti
on effects.

## MD&A Focus Areas

1. Results of operations with year-over-year variance analysis.
2. Liquidity and capital resources, including debt covenants and off-balance-sheet arrangements.
3. Critical accounting estimates and judgments (impairment, revenue recognition).
4. Market risk disclosures (interest rate, foreign currency, commodity exposure).

## Inline XBRL Tagging

- Tag primary financial statements, footnotes, and schedules using the U.S. GAAP Financial Reporting Taxonomy.
- Validate tagging accuracy to avoid SEC comment letters. Include calculation relationships and dimensional tagging where applica
ble.

## Internal Control Reporting

- Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 requires managementâ€™s annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR).
- Accelerated and large accelerated filers need auditor attestation on ICFR; smaller reporting companies may be exempt.
- Disclose material weaknesses and remediation efforts promptly; failure to do so can trigger SEC enforcement.

## Non-GAAP Measures

- Present non-GAAP metrics with equal or lesser prominence than the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
- Provide a quantitative reconciliation to GAAP and explain why management believes the measure is useful.

## Exam Tip: Filing Calendar Example

A calendar-year accelerated filer should plan:

- **February 14:** File Form 10-K (75-day deadline).
- **May 10, August 9, November 9:** File Forms 10-Q (40-day deadlines).
- **Within four business days of a major acquisition:** File Form 8-K and, if significant, pro forma financials under Article 11.

Understanding SEC reporting expectations helps you evaluate disclosure checklists and respond to FAR simulations involving registr
ant filings.
