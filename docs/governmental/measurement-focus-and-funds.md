# Measurement Focus and Funds

Governmental accounting uses fund accounting to segregate resources according to purpose and accountability. Each fund type employs a specific measurement focus and basis of accounting.

## Governmental Funds

- **Types:** General fund, special revenue, capital projects, debt service, permanent funds.
- **Measurement focus:** Current financial resources.
- **Basis of accounting:** Modified accrual (revenues recognized when measurable and available; expenditures when incurred with current resources).
- **Statements:** Balance sheet and statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balance.
- **Budgetary accounting:** Encumbrances recorded to track commitments.

## Proprietary Funds

- **Types:** Enterprise funds (services to external users) and internal service funds (services to other departments).
- **Measurement focus:** Economic resources.
- **Basis of accounting:** Accrual (similar to GAAP for businesses).
- **Statements:** Statement of net position, statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position, statement of cash flows (direct method required).

## Fiduciary Funds

- **Types:** Custodial, investment trust, private-purpose trust, pension (and other employee benefit) trust funds.
- **Measurement focus:** Economic resources.
- **Basis of accounting:** Accrual.
- **Statements:** Statement of fiduciary net position and statement of changes in fiduciary net position.
- Fiduciary activities are excluded from government-wide statements but require extensive disclosures.

## Government-Wide Statements

- Present governmental and business-type activities using the economic resources focus and accrual basis.
- Reconcile governmental fund statements to government-wide statements to account for differences in measurement focus and basis.

## Exam Tips

- Memorize which funds use modified accrual versus accrual accounting.
- Remember that proprietary fund statements resemble those of for-profit entities, including depreciation and long-term liabilities.
- Reconciliations often involve adding capital assets, subtracting long-term debt, and adjusting for deferred inflows/outflows.

Understanding measurement focus and fund types is foundational for answering governmental accounting questions on the FAR exam.
