# Governmental Accounting Overview

Governmental accounting follows the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) framework and emphasizes accountability for pub
lic resources. FAR candidates must understand fund structures, measurement focuses, and governmental financial reporting.

## Key Concepts

- **Accountability:** Governments report on stewardship and compliance with budgetary and legal constraints.
- **Fund accounting:** Segregates resources by purpose to ensure legal restrictions are observed.
- **Dual perspectives:** Financial reporting includes fund financial statements and government-wide statements, requiring reconcilia
  tions.

## Topics Covered

- Measurement focus and basis of accounting by fund type (governmental, proprietary, fiduciary).
- Government-wide statements prepared using the economic resources measurement focus and accrual basis.
- Budgetary accounting, encumbrances, and interfund transactions.
- Reconciliations between governmental fund statements and government-wide financials.

Each chapter provides journal entries, reconciliation schedules, and exam tips to help you navigate GASB terminology and reporting
