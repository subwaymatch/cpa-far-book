# Governmental Accounting Overview

Governmental accounting follows the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) framework and focuses on accountability for public resources. FAR candidates must understand fund structures, measurement focuses, and governmental financial reporting.

## Key Concepts

- **Accountability:** Governments report on stewardship and compliance with budgetary and legal constraints.
- **Fund accounting:** Segregates resources by purpose to ensure legal restrictions are observed.
- **Dual perspectives:** Financial reporting includes fund financial statements and government-wide statements.

## Topics Covered

- Measurement focus and basis of accounting by fund type.
- Fund categories (governmental, proprietary, fiduciary) and their statements.
- Government-wide financial statements and reconciliation to fund statements.
- Budgetary accounting, encumbrances, and interfund transactions.

Mastering governmental accounting equips you to handle specialized terminology and presentation requirements on the FAR exam.
