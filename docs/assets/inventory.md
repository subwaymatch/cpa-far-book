# Inventory

Inventory valuation affects both the balance sheet and the income statement. FAR candidates must master costing methods, lower of
cost or net realizable value adjustments, and specialized topics under ASC 330.

## Inventory Systems

- **Perpetual:** Continuously updates inventory and cost of goods sold (COGS) with each transaction.
- **Periodic:** Updates inventory at period end through physical counts and adjusts COGS using beginning inventory + purchases − e
  nding inventory.

## Costing Methods

- **FIFO (First-In, First-Out):** Ending inventory approximates current cost; COGS reflects older layers.
- **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out):** Matches recent costs to revenue; maintain a LIFO reserve to reconcile to FIFO disclosures. LIFO
  is still permitted under U.S. GAAP.
- **Weighted-average:** Uses average cost per unit for valuation.
- **Specific identification:** Appropriate for unique, high-value items.

### Journal Entry Example (Perpetual FIFO)

```text
Purchase:
Dr. Inventory          90,000
    Cr. Accounts payable     90,000

Sale of 500 units at $250 (cost $140):
Dr. Accounts receivable  125,000
    Cr. Sales revenue          125,000

Dr. Cost of goods sold    70,000
    Cr. Inventory                70,000
```

## Lower of Cost or Net Realizable Value (LCNRV)

- Applies to inventory measured using FIFO or weighted-average.
- Net realizable value equals estimated selling price minus costs of completion and disposal.
- Record write-downs to expense; reversals are prohibited under GAAP.

**LCNRV Example**

Merchandise cost is $60,000; NRV is $56,500.

```text
Dr. Loss on inventory write-down   3,500
    Cr. Inventory                        3,500
```

## Lower of Cost or Market (LCM) for LIFO and Retail

- Market equals replacement cost, limited by a ceiling (NRV) and floor (NRV − normal profit).
- Retail inventory method estimates ending inventory by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to ending inventory at retail.

## Additional Topics

- **Inventory errors:** Overstated ending inventory in Year 1 understates Year 2 beginning inventory and increases Year 2 COGS.
- **Purchase commitments:** Recognize losses when contract price exceeds market.

```text
Dr. Loss on purchase commitment   12,000
    Cr. Estimated liability on purchase commitment   12,000
```

- **Consignment:** Goods remain in the consignor's inventory until sold to end customers.
- **Manufacturing overhead:** Allocate fixed and variable overhead to production; excess idle capacity costs are expensed.

## Disclosure Checklist

1. Costing methods and any LIFO reserve adjustments.
2. Carrying amounts by category (raw materials, work in process, finished goods, supplies).
3. Significant write-downs and related causes.
4. Details of inventory pledged as collateral or subject to repurchase agreements.

Mastering inventory mechanics enables accurate COGS calculations and equips you for FAR simulations requiring valuation analyses
and rollforwards.
