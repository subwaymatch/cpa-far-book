# Inventory

Inventory valuation impacts both the balance sheet and income statement. FAR candidates must master costing methods, lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, and specialized inventory topics under ASC 330.

## Inventory Systems

- **Perpetual:** Continuously updates inventory and cost of goods sold (COGS) with each transaction.
- **Periodic:** Updates inventory at period end through physical counts and adjusts COGS using the formula beginning inventory + purchases − ending inventory.

## Costing Methods

- **FIFO (First-In, First-Out):** Assumes earliest purchases are sold first. Ending inventory approximates current cost; COGS reflects older costs.
- **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out):** Assumes latest purchases are sold first. Requires LIFO reserve disclosure; IFRS prohibits LIFO.
- **Weighted-average:** Uses average cost per unit for valuation.
- **Specific identification:** Used for unique, high-value items.

## Lower of Cost or Net Realizable Value (LCNRV)

- Applied to inventory measured using FIFO or weighted-average.
- Net realizable value (NRV) equals estimated selling price minus costs of completion and disposal.
- Record write-downs to expense; reversals are prohibited under GAAP (allowed under IFRS up to original cost).

## Lower of Cost or Market (LCM) — LIFO and Retail Inventory

- Market equals current replacement cost, constrained by ceiling (NRV) and floor (NRV minus normal profit margin).
- Retail inventory method estimates ending inventory using cost-to-retail ratios; maintain separate calculations for conventional, FIFO, and LIFO variants.

## Additional Topics

- **Inventory errors:** Affect both current and subsequent periods. Overstated ending inventory reduces COGS and overstates income.
- **Purchase commitments:** Losses recognized when contract price exceeds market; record estimated losses and liability.
- **Consigned goods:** Remain on consignor’s balance sheet until sold to third parties.
- **Capitalization of freight-in and handling costs** to inventory; freight-out is a selling expense.

## Disclosure Requirements

- Costing methods used and consistency between periods.
- Carrying amounts by inventory category (raw materials, work in process, finished goods).
- Significant write-downs or recoveries of previous write-downs (IFRS).

A solid grasp of inventory accounting is essential for solving cost flow problems and analyzing gross margin trends on the FAR exam.
