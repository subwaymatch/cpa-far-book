# Assets Overview

This section explores measurement, recognition, and disclosure issues for major asset classes. FAR candidates must apply GAAP guidance across cash, receivables, investments, inventory, property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets. Each chapter highlights key codification references, common journal entries, and exam tips.
