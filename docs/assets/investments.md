# Investments

Investments encompass debt and equity securities, as well as equity method and consolidation considerations. FAR candidates must categorize financial assets, measure them appropriately, and account for income recognition and impairment under ASC 320, ASC 321, ASC 323, and ASC 825.

## Debt Securities

- **Held-to-maturity (HTM):** Reported at amortized cost; use the effective interest method. Impairment assessed using the CECL model.
- **Available-for-sale (AFS):** Reported at fair value with unrealized gains/losses in OCI (except for credit losses, which impact earnings via an allowance).
- **Trading:** Reported at fair value with changes recognized in earnings.

## Equity Securities

- **Ownership < 20% without significant influence:** Record at fair value with changes in earnings (ASC 321). For nonmarketable securities, elect measurement alternative (cost minus impairment plus observable price changes).
- **Ownership 20%â€“50% or significant influence:** Apply the equity method; recognize share of investee income and adjust for basis differences.
- **Ownership > 50%:** Consolidate (covered in advanced topics).

## Other Key Concepts

- **Fair value option:** Irrevocable election to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in earnings (ASC 825).
- **Transfer between categories:** Reclassify at fair value on transfer date; treatment of unrealized gains/losses depends on direction of transfer.
- **Impairment:** Evaluate for credit losses (debt) or qualitative impairment indicators (equity method investments). Recognize impairments in earnings when declines are other-than-temporary.
- **Derivatives and hedging:** Although addressed separately, derivative instruments may be held as investments and require fair value measurement.

## IFRS Considerations

- IFRS 9 classifies financial assets based on business model and cash flow characteristics (amortized cost, FVOCI, FVPL).
- Equity investments can be designated at FVOCI with no recycling of gains/losses to profit or loss.

## Disclosure Requirements

1. Amortized cost, fair value, and unrealized gains/losses by category.
2. Rollforward of allowance for credit losses on AFS and HTM debt securities.
3. Carrying amounts and fair values of equity method investments, including summarized financial information when material.
4. Concentrations of credit risk and valuation techniques for fair value measurements.

Understanding investment accounting enables accurate recognition of income, OCI, and impairments while ensuring proper classification on the balance sheet.
