# Investments

Investments include debt and equity securities as well as equity method holdings. FAR candidates must classify instruments, appl
y measurement rules under ASC 320, ASC 321, and ASC 323, and recognize income and impairment correctly.

## Debt Securities

- **Held-to-maturity (HTM):** Reported at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Subject to current expected credit
 losses (CECL).
- **Available-for-sale (AFS):** Reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses in OCI, except that credit losses hit ear
nings through an allowance.
- **Trading:** Reported at fair value with all changes in earnings.

**Effective Interest Example (AFS Bond)**

A $100,000 bond purchased at $96,530 (5-year, 6% stated rate, 8% yield). Interest received annually.

```text
Year 1 interest:
Cash received (6% × $100,000)                   $6,000
Interest income (8% × $96,530)                  $7,722
Amortization of discount                        $1,722

Entry:
Dr. Cash                                  6,000
Dr. Investment in AFS debt securities     1,722
    Cr. Interest income                         7,722
```

If fair value at year end is $97,800, recognize unrealized gain in OCI:

```text
Dr. Investment in AFS debt securities  1,270
    Cr. OCI – unrealized gain                1,270
```

## Equity Securities (ASC 321)

- Measure at fair value through earnings when readily determinable.
- For nonmarketable equity securities, use the measurement alternative (cost minus impairment plus observable price changes).

**Measurement Alternative Example**

Initial investment $50,000. During the year, an observable transaction indicates fair value of $62,000.

```text
Dr. Investment in equity securities   12,000
    Cr. Gain on investment                 12,000
```

## Equity Method Investments (ASC 323)

- Apply when the investor has significant influence (generally 20%–50% ownership).
- Record the investment at cost and adjust for the investor's share of earnings, dividends, and basis differences.

```text
Initial investment (30% interest):
Dr. Investment in affiliate   150,000
    Cr. Cash                          150,000

Share of earnings ($80,000 × 30%):
Dr. Investment in affiliate    24,000
    Cr. Equity in earnings of affiliate   24,000

Dividends received ($40,000 × 30%):
Dr. Cash                       12,000
    Cr. Investment in affiliate        12,000
```

## Transfers Between Categories

Reclassify at fair value on the transfer date and adjust accumulated OCI as required. For example, transferring AFS to trading:

```text
Dr. Investment in trading securities   105,000
    Cr. Investment in AFS securities        102,500
    Cr. OCI – unrealized gain                2,500
```

## Impairment Considerations

- For AFS debt securities, recognize credit losses through an allowance limited to the difference between amortized cost and fai
r value.
- For HTM debt, record lifetime expected credit losses through a valuation allowance.
- For equity method investments, test for impairment when a decline in value is other than temporary.

## Disclosure Checklist

1. Amortized cost, fair value, and unrealized gains/losses by classification.
2. Rollforward of allowance for credit losses on AFS and HTM securities.
3. Carrying amounts, earnings, and dividends from equity method investees with summarized investee information when material.
4. Concentrations of credit risk and valuation techniques used for fair value measurements.

Mastering investment accounting ensures accurate income recognition and OCI presentation while supporting analysis of liquidity a
nd market risk.
