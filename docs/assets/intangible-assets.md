# Intangible Assets

Intangible assets lack physical substance but provide future economic benefits. FAR candidates must distinguish between purchase
d and internally developed intangibles, determine useful lives, and apply impairment guidance under ASC 350 and related standard
s.

## Recognition and Measurement

- **Purchased intangibles:** Record at cost, including purchase price and directly attributable legal fees.
- **Internally developed intangibles:** Generally expense as incurred except for certain costs like internal-use software during
  the application development stage (ASC 350-40) or successful defense of patents.
- **Business combinations:** Recognize identifiable intangibles separately from goodwill when they arise from contractual/legal r
  ights or are separable.

**Acquisition Entry Example**

A company purchases a customer list for $120,000 and incurs $5,000 in legal fees to execute the contract.

```text
Dr. Customer list intangible   125,000
    Cr. Cash                           125,000
```

## Useful Life Classification

- **Finite-lived intangibles:** Amortize over the shorter of economic or legal life, often on a straight-line basis.
- **Indefinite-lived intangibles:** Not amortized; test at least annually for impairment.
- **Goodwill:** Tested at the reporting unit level with optional qualitative assessment.

**Amortization Example**

Trademark cost $90,000, legal life 10 years, no residual value.

```text
Dr. Amortization expense     9,000
    Cr. Accumulated amortization   9,000
```

## Impairment Testing

- **Finite-lived intangibles:** Perform a recoverability test (undiscounted cash flows vs. carrying amount). If not recoverable, i
  mpairment = carrying amount − fair value.
- **Indefinite-lived intangibles:** Compare fair value directly to carrying amount after optional qualitative assessment.
- **Goodwill:** If reporting unit carrying amount exceeds fair value, recognize impairment up to the amount of goodwill.

```text
Finite-lived impairment example:
Carrying amount 150,000; undiscounted cash flows 130,000; fair value 120,000.
Dr. Impairment loss          30,000
    Cr. Accumulated impairment loss   30,000
```

## Special Topics

- **Research and development (ASC 730):** Expense as incurred except equipment with alternative future use, which is capitalized
  and depreciated.
- **Software:**
  - **Software for sale:** Capitalize costs incurred after technological feasibility (ASC 985-20).
  - **Internal-use software:** Capitalize application development costs; expense preliminary project and post-implementation trai
    ning costs.
- **Franchise rights and licenses:** Amortize over the contractual term, including renewal periods only if renewal is reasonably
  assured.

## Disclosure Checklist

1. Gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by major class of intangible assets.
2. Aggregate amortization expense and estimated expense for each of the next five years.
3. Description of impairment losses and valuation techniques used.
4. Changes in goodwill by reporting unit, including acquisitions, dispositions, and impairment charges.

Intangible asset accounting demands careful judgment about future benefits and impairment triggers—skills that appear frequently
in FAR simulations.
