# Intangible Assets

Intangible assets lack physical substance but provide economic benefits. FAR candidates must distinguish between purchased and internally developed intangibles, determine useful lives, and apply impairment guidance under ASC 350.

## Recognition and Measurement

- **Purchased intangibles:** Record at cost, including purchase price and directly attributable costs.
- **Internally developed intangibles:** Generally expensed as incurred, except for certain costs such as software development (ASC 985-20, ASC 350-40) and legal fees for successful defense of patents.
- **Business combinations:** Recognize identifiable intangibles separately from goodwill when they arise from contractual or legal rights or are separable.

## Useful Life Classification

- **Finite-lived intangibles:** Amortize over the shorter of economic or legal life, using straight-line or another systematic method. Review for impairment when indicators arise.
- **Indefinite-lived intangibles:** Do not amortize; test at least annually for impairment and more frequently if events indicate potential impairment.

## Impairment Testing

- **Finite-lived:** Compare carrying amount to undiscounted cash flows (recoverability test). If not recoverable, impairment equals carrying amount minus fair value.
- **Indefinite-lived:** Perform qualitative assessment (optional). If more likely than not impaired, compare fair value to carrying amount; recognize impairment for excess.
- **Goodwill:** Tested at reporting unit level under ASC 350-20. Option to perform qualitative test; if quantitative test required, compare fair value of reporting unit with carrying amount.

## Special Topics

- **Research and development (R&D):** Expense as incurred, except alternative future use equipment, which is capitalized and depreciated.
- **Software:** Differentiate between software for sale (capitalize after technological feasibility) and internal-use software (capitalize during application development stage).
- **Franchise rights and licenses:** Amortize over contractual period unless renewals are reasonably assured.

## IFRS Differences

- Development costs meeting specific criteria are capitalized under IAS 38; research costs are expensed.
- Impairment testing uses one-step model comparing carrying amount to recoverable amount (higher of fair value less costs to sell or value in use).

## Disclosure Highlights

1. Schedule of gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by class of intangible assets.
2. Aggregate amortization expense for the current period and estimated expense for each of the next five years.
3. Description of impairment losses and valuation techniques used.

Intangible asset accounting requires careful judgement about future economic benefits and appropriate impairment triggersâ€”skills heavily tested on the FAR exam.
