# Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) are long-lived tangible assets used in operations. FAR candidates must account for acquisi
tion, depreciation, impairment, and disposal under ASC 360 and related guidance.

## Acquisition and Capitalization

- Capitalize costs necessary to place the asset in service: purchase price, taxes, freight-in, installation, testing, and profes
  sional fees.
- Self-constructed assets include direct materials, direct labor, and applicable overhead; capitalize interest during constructio
  n (ASC 835-20) for the portion of expenditures financed with borrowings.
- Recognize asset retirement obligations (AROs) at present value when a legal obligation exists to retire an asset (ASC 410-20).

**Acquisition Entry Example**

```text
Dr. Equipment                        525,000
Dr. Construction in progress          12,000  (testing)
Dr. Asset retirement cost             18,000
    Cr. Cash                                   537,000
    Cr. ARO liability                           18,000
```

## Depreciation Methods

- **Straight-line:** `(Cost − salvage) ÷ useful life`.
- **Double-declining balance:** `2 ÷ useful life × beginning book value`.
- **Sum-of-the-years'-digits:** Applies an accelerating fraction to depreciable base.
- **Units-of-production:** `(Cost − salvage) ÷ total units × actual units` for volume-driven assets.

**Straight-Line Example**

Equipment cost $500,000, salvage $20,000, life 10 years. Annual depreciation = $(500,000 − 20,000) ÷ 10 = 48,000$.

Dr. Depreciation expense   48,000
    Cr. Accumulated depreciation   48,000
```

## Subsequent Expenditures

- Capitalize improvements that extend useful life or increase productivity.
- Expense ordinary repairs.
- When replacing a component, remove its carrying amount and capitalize the new part.

```text
Dr. Accumulated depreciation   35,000
    Cr. Equipment                        35,000   (removal)

Dr. Equipment                  80,000
    Cr. Cash                            80,000    (new component)
```

## Impairment Testing

- **Held and used assets:** Test for recoverability when events indicate impairment. If undiscounted future cash flows < carrying
  amount, recognize impairment equal to carrying amount minus fair value.
- **Held for sale assets:** Measure at lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and cease depreciation.

**Impairment Entry Example**

Carrying amount $310,000; fair value $260,000; undiscounted cash flows $280,000.

```text
Dr. Impairment loss   50,000
    Cr. Accumulated impairment loss   50,000
```

## Disposals and Exchanges

- Record gains and losses as the difference between proceeds and carrying amount when assets are sold or abandoned.
- Exchanges lacking commercial substance defer gains unless boot received is significant (≥25%).

Sale example:
Dr. Cash                        150,000
Dr. Accumulated depreciation    70,000
    Cr. Equipment                         200,000
    Cr. Gain on sale of equipment          20,000
```

## Disclosure Checklist

1. Reconciliation of beginning and ending balances by major class of PP&E, including additions, disposals, and depreciation.
2. Depreciation methods, useful lives, and gross carrying amounts.
3. Amount of interest capitalized and the capitalization rate applied.
4. Asset retirement obligations and changes in estimates.

PP&E problems frequently integrate capitalization rules, depreciation schedules, and impairment triggers—practice constructing r
ollforward schedules and journal entries for each stage of an asset’s life cycle.
