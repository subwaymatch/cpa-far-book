# Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) are long-lived tangible assets used in operations. FAR candidates must account for acquisition, depreciation, impairment, and disposal under ASC 360.

## Acquisition and Capitalization

- Capitalize costs necessary to place the asset in service: purchase price, taxes, freight-in, installation, testing, and professional fees.
- Self-constructed assets include direct materials, labor, and overhead; interest capitalization applies during construction (ASC 835-20).
- Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are recognized at present value when a legal obligation exists to retire the asset.

## Depreciation Methods

- **Straight-line:** (Cost − salvage) ÷ useful life.
- **Accelerated methods:** Double-declining balance, sum-of-the-years'-digits.
- **Units-of-production:** (Cost − salvage) ÷ total expected units × units produced.
- Component depreciation (IFRS requirement in some cases) depreciates significant parts separately.

## Subsequent Expenditures

- Capitalize expenditures that extend useful life, increase capacity, or improve efficiency.
- Expense routine maintenance and repairs.
- Record replacements by removing the carrying amount of the old component and capitalizing the new cost.

## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

- **Held and used:** Apply recoverability test comparing carrying amount to undiscounted cash flows. If not recoverable, impairment loss equals carrying amount minus fair value.
- **Held for sale:** Measure at lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell; cease depreciation.

## Disposals and Exchanges

- Recognize gains or losses for difference between proceeds and carrying amount.
- Exchanges lacking commercial substance recognize gain only if boot received exceeds 25% of consideration.

## IFRS Differences

- IAS 16 allows revaluation model with periodic remeasurement to fair value and recognition of revaluation surplus in OCI.
- Impairment testing uses recoverable amount (higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use).

## Disclosure Requirements

1. Reconciliation of beginning and ending balances by major class of PP&E, including additions, disposals, depreciation, and impairments.
2. Depreciation methods, useful lives, and gross carrying amounts.
3. Amount of interest capitalized during the period.
4. ARO liabilities and changes in estimates.

PP&E questions often integrate capitalization policies, depreciation calculations, and impairment triggers—be prepared to address all stages of an asset’s life cycle.
