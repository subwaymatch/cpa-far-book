# Cash and Receivables

Cash and receivables are highly liquid assets subject to stringent control, measurement, and presentation requirements under ASC
305, ASC 326, and ASC 310. FAR questions often combine bank reconciliation tasks with allowance calculations.

## Cash and Cash Equivalents

- Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less (Treasury bills, m
  oney market funds).
- Restricted cash is reported separately and classified as current or noncurrent based on the restriction period.
- Bank reconciliations adjust book to bank balances by considering deposits in transit, outstanding checks, bank charges, and er
  rors.

**Example Bank Reconciliation Entry**

Bank statement shows a $45 service charge and $2,000 NSF check returned. The book balance must be reduced:

Dr. Bank service charge expense   45
Dr. Accounts receivable         2,000
    Cr. Cash                             2,045
```

## Accounts Receivable and CECL

- Recognize receivables when the entity has an unconditional right to consideration.
- Present receivables net of an allowance for credit losses calculated using the current expected credit loss (CECL) model.
- Estimation techniques include historical loss rates adjusted for reasonable forecasts, aging schedules, and probability-weighte
  d scenarios.

**Allowance Adjustment Example**

An aging schedule indicates lifetime expected credit losses of $12,500. The allowance currently has a $4,000 credit balance.

```text
Dr. Bad debt expense                 8,500
    Cr. Allowance for credit losses      8,500
```

## Notes Receivable

- Record notes receivable at present value if issued at a below-market rate.
- Accrue interest using the effective interest method.
- For noninterest-bearing notes issued for inventory, record revenue at the fair value of the note.

**Noninterest-Bearing Note Example**

A $100,000, two-year note is issued with a 6% market rate; present value is $89,000.

```text
At issuance:
Dr. Notes receivable      100,000
    Cr. Sales revenue             89,000
    Cr. Discount on note          11,000

Year-end interest accrual:
Dr. Discount on note       5,340
    Cr. Interest income           5,340
```

## Write-Offs and Recoveries

- Write-offs reduce both the receivable and allowance balances.
- Recoveries reinstate the receivable and allowance before collecting cash.

```text
Write-off:
Dr. Allowance for credit losses   3,200
    Cr. Accounts receivable             3,200

Recovery:
Dr. Accounts receivable          3,200
    Cr. Allowance for credit losses     3,200
Dr. Cash                         3,200
    Cr. Accounts receivable             3,200
```

## Factoring and Securitization

- Treat transfers as sales when the transferee assumes control and the transferor surrenders effective control (ASC 860).
- Otherwise, record as secured borrowings with pledge disclosures.

```text
Secured borrowing example:
Dr. Cash                     90,000
Dr. Finance charge expense    3,000
    Cr. Notes payable â€“ factoring    93,000
```

Strong command of these concepts enables you to evaluate liquidity and design adjusting entries that reconcile subsidiary ledger
s to the balance sheet.
