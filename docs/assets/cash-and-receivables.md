# Cash and Receivables

Cash and receivables are highly liquid assets subject to stringent internal control and measurement requirements. FAR candidates must understand classification, valuation, and presentation under ASC 305 and ASC 310.

## Cash and Cash Equivalents

- **Cash equivalents** are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less (e.g., Treasury bills, money market funds).
- **Restricted cash** must be segregated and disclosed; classify as current or noncurrent based on the restriction period.
- **Bank reconciliations** adjust book balances for deposits in transit, outstanding checks, bank service charges, and errors.

## Accounts Receivable

- Recognize receivables when the entity has an unconditional right to consideration.
- Present receivables net of **allowance for credit losses** under ASC 326 (CECL model).
- **Allowance methods:** Historical loss rates, probability-weighted scenarios, or aging schedules adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts.
- **Factoring and securitization:** Determine whether transfers qualify as sales (derecognition) or secured borrowings.

## Notes Receivable

- Record at face value and accrue interest using the effective interest method.
- When received in exchange for goods/services, record at the fair value of the consideration or the note, whichever is more clearly determinable.
- Noninterest-bearing notes are recorded at present value with discount amortized to interest income.

## Impairment and Write-offs

- Under CECL, recognize lifetime expected credit losses upon initial recognition.
- Write-offs reduce both the gross receivable and the allowance account; recoveries increase both.
- Troubled debt restructurings may involve term modifications or concessions; evaluate for gain/loss recognition.

## Internal Control Considerations

- Segregate duties for custody, record keeping, and authorization.
- Require timely reconciliation and independent review.
- Monitor days sales outstanding and credit policy adherence.

Mastery of cash and receivable accounting helps prevent misstatements and supports analysis of liquidity and credit risk.
