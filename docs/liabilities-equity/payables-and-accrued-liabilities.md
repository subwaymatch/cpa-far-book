# Payables and Accrued Liabilities

Current liabilities encompass obligations due within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. FAR candidates must account for trade payables, accrued expenses, and contingent liabilities in accordance with ASC 405 and ASC 450.

## Accounts Payable

- Record invoices when goods or services are received, net of purchase discounts if the gross method is not used.
- Adjust for purchase returns, allowances, and discounts taken.
- Monitor days payable outstanding to manage working capital.

## Accrued Expenses

- Recognize liabilities for expenses incurred but not yet paid, such as payroll, interest, taxes, and utilities.
- Accrued compensation includes payroll taxes, vacation, and bonuses. Bonus liabilities should be estimated when probable and reasonably estimable.
- Interest accrues on outstanding debt using the effective interest method.

## Sales and Use Taxes

- Collect sales taxes on behalf of taxing authorities; record liability until remitted.
- For use taxes on purchases, accrue liability when taxable purchase occurs.

## Contingencies and Commitments

- Apply ASC 450: accrue loss contingencies when **probable** and **reasonably estimable**. Otherwise disclose the nature of the contingency and possible loss range.
- Gain contingencies are not recognized until realized; disclose only when probability of realization is high.
- Examples include litigation, warranties, guarantees, and environmental obligations.

## Payroll and Withholding

- Employer liabilities include FICA, FUTA, SUTA, workersâ€™ compensation, and fringe benefits.
- Record withholdings from employees for federal and state income taxes and remit timely to avoid penalties.

## Exam Tips

- Remember that refinancing a short-term obligation on a long-term basis before the issuance of financial statements allows noncurrent classification if certain criteria are met (covered in long-term debt chapter).
- Understand journal entries for warranty accruals and subsequent claims.
- Distinguish between compensated absences that vest (accrue) versus nonvesting benefits (disclose if probable).

Proper accounting for payables and accruals ensures liabilities are not understated and helps evaluate liquidity.
