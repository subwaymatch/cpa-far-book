# Payables and Accrued Liabilities

Current liabilities include obligations due within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. FAR candidates must acco
unt for trade payables, accrued expenses, and contingencies under ASC 405 and ASC 450.

## Accounts Payable

- Record invoices when goods or services are received. Use the gross or net method for purchase discounts.

```text
Invoice received 2/10, n/30 (gross method):
Dr. Inventory           50,000
    Cr. Accounts payable      50,000

Payment within discount period:
Dr. Accounts payable    50,000
    Cr. Cash                   49,000
    Cr. Purchase discounts     1,000
```

- Adjust for purchase returns, allowances, and discounts forfeited. Monitor days payable outstanding to manage working capital.

## Accrued Expenses

- Recognize liabilities for expenses incurred but unpaidâ€”payroll, interest, utilities, taxes.

## Sales and Use Taxes

- Collect sales taxes on behalf of taxing authorities and record a liability until remitted.

```text

Dr. Cash             10,800
    Cr. Sales revenue      10,000
    Cr. Sales tax payable     800
```

## Contingencies and Commitments (ASC 450)

- Accrue loss contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable; otherwise disclose.

```text
Dr. Warranty expense    25,000
    Cr. Warranty liability     25,000
```

- Gain contingencies remain unrecognized until realized; disclose only when probability of realization is high.

## Payroll and Withholding

Record gross payroll, employee withholdings, and employer payroll taxes:

```text
Dr. Salaries expense              150,000
    Cr. FICA taxes payable              11,475
    Cr. Federal income taxes payable    24,000
    Cr. State income taxes payable       7,500
    Cr. Cash                             107,025

Employer payroll tax entry:
Dr. Payroll tax expense        11,475
    Cr. FICA taxes payable           11,475
```

## Exam Tips

- Short-term obligations refinanced on a long-term basis before the financial statements are issued may be reclassified as noncu
  rrent when ASC 470 criteria are met.
- Distinguish between compensated absences that vest (accrue) versus nonvesting benefits (disclose if probable).
- Track contingent liabilities through rollforwards to support footnote disclosures.

Accurate accounting for payables and accruals prevents understatement of liabilities and supports liquidity analysis.
