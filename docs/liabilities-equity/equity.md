# Equity

Equity represents the residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting liabilities. FAR candidates must account for equity issuances, treasury stock, dividends, retained earnings, and equity-based compensation under ASC 505 and ASC 718.

## Equity Structure

- **Common stock:** Par or stated value times shares issued; additional paid-in capital records amounts above par.
- **Preferred stock:** May be cumulative, noncumulative, participating, or convertible. Dividends typically expressed as a percentage of par value.
- **Retained earnings:** Accumulated undistributed profits; adjust for prior period errors and changes in accounting principle.
- **Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI):** Aggregates OCI components (see comprehensive income chapter).

## Equity Transactions

- **Issuances:** Record cash or noncash consideration received. For noncash issuances, measure at fair value of consideration received or stock issued.
- **Treasury stock:** Cost method (default) or par value method. Differences between cost and reissuance proceeds adjust additional paid-in capital or retained earnings.
- **Stock splits and stock dividends:** Splits change shares outstanding without affecting total equity. Stock dividends reclassify retained earnings to paid-in capital.
- **Share-based compensation:** Recognize compensation cost over vesting period based on grant-date fair value for equity awards; liability awards are remeasured each period.

## Dividends

- **Cash dividends:** Recorded when declared (debit retained earnings, credit dividends payable).
- **Property dividends:** Distribute noncash assets; restate asset to fair value with gain/loss recognized before distribution.
- **Liquidating dividends:** Return of capital; reduce additional paid-in capital before retained earnings.
- **Preferred dividends:** Must be satisfied before common dividends; cumulative dividends accumulate in arrears.

## Book Value Per Share

- Common shareholders' equity รท common shares outstanding.
- Deduct preferred stock liquidation preferences when computing for common stock.

## Disclosure Requirements

1. Terms of each class of stock, including rights and preferences.
2. Shares authorized, issued, and outstanding.
3. Dividend restrictions or appropriations.
4. Details of equity compensation plans, including shares available for issuance.

Understanding equity transactions supports preparation of the statement of changes in equity and analysis of shareholder returns on the FAR exam.
