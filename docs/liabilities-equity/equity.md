# Equity

Equity represents the residual interest in an entity’s assets after deducting liabilities. FAR candidates must account for issuanc
es, treasury stock transactions, dividends, retained earnings adjustments, and equity-based compensation under ASC 505 and ASC 718
.

## Equity Structure

- **Common stock:** Par or stated value multiplied by shares issued. Amounts received above par go to additional paid-in capital (A
PIC).
- **Preferred stock:** May be cumulative, participating, or convertible. Cumulative preferred dividends accumulate in arrears until
 paid.
- **Retained earnings:** Accumulated undistributed profits; adjust for prior-period errors and changes in accounting principle.
- **Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI):** Aggregates OCI components.

## Issuances and Noncash Consideration

    Cr. Common stock          15,000

    Cr. APIC                 80,000
```

## Treasury Stock (Cost Method)

- Record repurchases at cost; no gain/loss on reissuance.

```text
Repurchase 2,000 shares at $18:
Dr. Treasury stock    36,000
    Cr. Cash                 36,000

    Cr. Treasury stock       36,000
    Cr. APIC – treasury       8,000
```

If reissued below cost and APIC – treasury is insufficient, charge retained earnings.

## Dividends

- **Cash dividends:** Recognize liability on declaration date.

```text
