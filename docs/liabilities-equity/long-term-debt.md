# Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt provides financing beyond one year. FAR candidates must understand bond issuance, amortization, refinancing, covenant compliance, and disclosure requirements under ASC 470.

## Types of Long-Term Debt

- **Bonds payable:** Issued at par, discount, or premium. Amortize using effective interest method (required under GAAP; straight-line allowed if not materially different).
- **Notes payable:** May have fixed or variable rates; measure at present value of future payments.
- **Mortgage debt:** Secured by property with blended payments of principal and interest.
- **Convertible debt:** Contains equity features; may require separation of conversion option under ASC 470-20 and ASC 815.

## Issuance and Costs

- Record cash proceeds net of discounts or premiums.
- **Debt issuance costs** are capitalized and amortized over the term as a direct reduction of the carrying amount of the debt (for bonds) or as an asset for line-of-credit arrangements.

## Amortization Example

1. Determine the effective interest rate using issuance price and cash flows.
2. Compute periodic interest expense = carrying amount Ã— effective interest rate.
3. Difference between interest expense and cash interest paid adjusts the carrying amount.

## Early Extinguishment and Modifications

- Recognize gains/losses equal to the difference between reacquisition price and net carrying amount.
- For troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), evaluate concessions granted by the creditor; follow ASC 470-60.
- When debt terms are modified and the change is substantial (10% test), treat as extinguishment; otherwise, adjust effective interest rate prospectively.

## Classification Issues

- Short-term obligations expected to be refinanced on a long-term basis can be classified as noncurrent if intent and ability are demonstrated before financial statements are issued.
- Violations of debt covenants may require reclassification unless waivers are obtained.

## Disclosure Checklist

1. Maturity schedule for the next five years.
2. Interest rates, collateral, and restrictive covenants.
3. Aggregate amounts of unused lines of credit.
4. Details of convertible features, call provisions, and sinking fund requirements.

Mastering long-term debt accounting helps you compute interest amortization schedules and analyze financing structures encountered on the FAR exam.
