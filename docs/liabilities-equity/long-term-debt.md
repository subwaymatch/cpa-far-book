# Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt provides financing beyond one year. FAR candidates must understand bond issuance, amortization, refinancing, coven
ant compliance, and disclosure requirements under ASC 470.

## Types of Long-Term Debt

- **Bonds payable:** Issued at par, discount, or premium. Use the effective interest method (required unless results approximate
 straight-line).
- **Notes payable:** Record at present value of future payments using the market rate at issuance.
- **Mortgage debt:** Secured by property with blended principal and interest payments.
- **Convertible debt:** May contain embedded conversion features evaluated under ASC 470-20 and ASC 815.

## Issuance and Debt Issuance Costs

- Record proceeds net of discounts/premiums and deduct debt issuance costs from the carrying amount.

Issued $1,000,000 bonds at 98 with $25,000 issuance costs:
Dr. Cash                     955,000
Dr. Discount on bonds payable 45,000
    Cr. Bonds payable                1,000,000
```

## Effective Interest Amortization Example

10-year bonds, 6% stated rate, issued at 95. Present value implies effective rate 7%.

| Period | Carrying Amount | Interest Expense (7%) | Cash Paid (6%) | Amortization |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Year 1 | 950,000 | 66,500 | 60,000 | 6,500 |
| Year 2 | 956,500 | 66,955 | 60,000 | 6,955 |

Year 1 entry:

```text
Dr. Interest expense   66,500
    Cr. Discount on bonds payable   6,500
    Cr. Cash                         60,000
```

## Early Extinguishment

When debt is retired before maturity, compare the reacquisition price with the net carrying amount.

```text
Reacquired bonds for 102 when carrying amount is 970,000:
Dr. Bonds payable                 1,000,000
Dr. Loss on extinguishment          30,000
    Cr. Discount on bonds payable       30,000
    Cr. Cash                          1,000,000
```

## Debt Modifications and TDRs

- Apply the 10% cash flow test to determine if a modification is substantial (treat as extinguishment if â‰¥10%).
- Troubled debt restructurings (ASC 470-60) recognize gains when total future cash flows after restructuring are less than the c
arrying amount.

TDR example (interest rate reduced):
Dr. Notes payable          20,000
    Cr. Gain on restructuring      20,000
```

## Classification and Covenants

- Short-term obligations refinanced on a long-term basis before statements are issued may remain noncurrent if intent and abilit
y (e.g., refinancing agreement) are demonstrated.
- Covenant violations require reclassification unless waived by the lender before the balance sheet date or grace period granted
.

## Disclosure Checklist

1. Maturity schedule for each of the next five years.
2. Interest rates, collateral, and restrictive covenants.
3. Amounts available under lines of credit and unused commitments.
4. Convertible features, call provisions, and sinking fund requirements.

Mastering long-term debt accounting equips you to construct amortization schedules and analyze financing structures on the FAR e
xam.
