# Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

Accounting changes and error corrections require careful treatment to preserve comparability across periods. FAR candidates must di
fferentiate among changes in accounting principle, changes in accounting estimate, changes in reporting entity, and error correctio
ns under ASC 250.

## Change in Accounting Principle

- Switch from one GAAP principle to another (e.g., LIFO to FIFO). Apply retrospectively unless impracticable, adjusting beginning r
etained earnings and restating prior periods.

### Example: LIFO to FIFO

Ending inventory would have been $80,000 higher in Year 1 and $110,000 higher in Year 2 under FIFO. Tax rate 25%.

```text
Cumulative effect = (80,000 + 110,000) × (1 − 0.25) = 142,500
Dr. Inventory                 110,000  (current year adjustment)
Dr. Retained earnings         142,500
    Cr. Deferred tax liability      47,500
    Cr. Inventory                      205,000 (to adjust prior years)
```

Restate prior-year financial statements to reflect FIFO balances.

## Change in Accounting Estimate

- Result from new information (e.g., useful life, bad debt percentages). Account prospectively—no restatement.

```text
Remaining depreciable base $120,000; revised remaining life 6 years:
New annual depreciation = 120,000 ÷ 6 = 20,000
Dr. Depreciation expense   20,000
    Cr. Accumulated depreciation   20,000
```

## Change in Reporting Entity

- Occurs when consolidated or combined statements include a different set of entities (e.g., adding a subsidiary). Apply retrospec
tively, presenting comparative statements as if the new entity had always been included.

## Error Corrections

- Include mathematical mistakes, misuse of facts, or misapplication of GAAP. Correct by restating prior periods and adjusting begin
ning retained earnings of the earliest period presented.

### Example: Accrued Expense Omitted

Prior year omitted $50,000 of salary expense; tax rate 25%.

```text
Dr. Retained earnings    37,500
    Cr. Salaries payable       50,000
    Dr. Deferred tax asset     12,500
```

Restate prior-period income statement and balance sheet to reflect the correction.

## Adoption of New Standards

- Follow transition guidance specified in the new standard (full retrospective, modified retrospective, or prospective). Disclose m
ethod, quantitative impacts, and qualitative considerations.

## Impracticability Exception

- Retrospective application is impracticable when period-specific effects or cumulative effects cannot be determined. Apply prospec
tively from the earliest practicable date and disclose why retrospective treatment was not feasible.

## Exam Tips

- Distinguish between changes in estimate (prospective) and principle (retrospective).
- Remember that depreciation method changes are treated as changes in estimate effected by a change in principle (prospective).
- For error corrections, prepare restated comparative statements and adjust retained earnings net of tax.

Proper handling of accounting changes enhances transparency and maintains confidence in financial reporting.
