# Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

Accounting changes and error corrections require careful treatment to ensure comparability across periods. FAR candidates must differentiate among changes in accounting principle, changes in accounting estimate, changes in reporting entity, and error corrections under ASC 250.

## Types of Accounting Changes

- **Change in accounting principle:** Switch from one GAAP principle to another (e.g., LIFO to FIFO). Apply retrospectively unless impracticable, adjusting beginning retained earnings and restating prior periods.
- **Change in accounting estimate:** Adjustments resulting from new information (e.g., useful life of equipment). Account prospectively—do not restate prior periods.
- **Change in reporting entity:** Occurs when consolidated or combined financial statements present a different reporting entity (e.g., changing subsidiaries included). Apply retrospectively with appropriate disclosures.

## Error Corrections

- Include mathematical mistakes, misuse of facts, or misapplication of GAAP.
- Correct by restating prior-period financial statements and adjusting beginning retained earnings of the earliest period presented.
- Disclose nature of the error, impact on prior periods, and effect on basic and diluted EPS (if applicable).

## Adoption of New Standards

- Follow transition guidance provided in the standard (e.g., full retrospective, modified retrospective, prospective).
- Disclose method of adoption, effect on financial statements, and qualitative description of changes.

## Impracticability Exception

- Retrospective application is impracticable when period-specific effects cannot be determined, the cumulative effect cannot be determined, or the cost outweighs the benefit.
- In such cases, apply the new principle prospectively from earliest practicable date and disclose reasons.

## Exam Tips

- Identify whether a change stems from new information (estimate) or an intentional policy change (principle).
- Remember that depreciation method changes are treated as changes in estimate effected by a change in principle—accounted for prospectively.
- For error corrections, prepare restated comparative statements and adjust retained earnings net of tax.

Proper handling of accounting changes ensures transparency and maintains the integrity of financial reporting across periods.
