# Fair Value Measurements

Fair value under ASC 820 is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transa
ction between market participants at the measurement date. FAR candidates must understand valuation techniques, the fair value hier
archy, and disclosure requirements.

## Fair Value Hierarchy

- **Level 1:** Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (e.g., publicly traded equity securities).
- **Level 2:** Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets, interest rates, and yield cur
  ves.
- **Level 3:** Unobservable inputs reflecting the entity’s own assumptions about market participant expectations.

Classification is based on the lowest-level significant input used in the valuation.

## Valuation Techniques

- **Market approach:** Uses market transactions and comparable pricing.
- **Income approach:** Converts future cash flows to present value using discount rates (discounted cash flow, option pricing).
- **Cost approach:** Reflects current replacement cost to replace service capacity.

Select techniques that maximize observable inputs and minimize unobservable inputs.

## Illustrative Example

An investment fund holds a private equity security requiring Level 3 inputs. Expected cash flows are $40,000 in Year 1 and $60,000
in Year 2; discount rate 10%.

```text
Fair value = 40,000 / (1.10)^1 + 60,000 / (1.10)^2 = 36,364 + 49,587 = 85,951

Entry to mark to fair value:
Dr. Investment in equity securities   5,951
    Cr. Gain on fair value adjustment      5,951
```

## Highest and Best Use

- Applies to nonfinancial assets; consider physically possible, legally permissible, and financially feasible uses.
- Liabilities and an entity’s own equity instruments assume transfer to a market participant who assumes the obligation at the mea
  surement date.

## Nonrecurring vs. Recurring Measurements

- **Recurring:** Measured at fair value each period (trading securities, derivatives).
- **Nonrecurring:** Triggered by specific events (asset impairments, business combinations).

## Level 3 Rollforward Example

| Activity                         | Amount   |
| -------------------------------- | -------- |
| Beginning balance                | 82,000   |
| Total gains included in earnings | 5,951    |
| Purchases                        | 10,000   |
| Sales                            | (12,000) |
| Transfers                        | —        |
| Ending balance                   | 85,951   |

Provide qualitative discussion of valuation techniques (e.g., discounted cash flow) and significant unobservable inputs (growth rat
es, discount rates).

## Disclosures

1. Hierarchy level for each class of assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
2. Valuation techniques and inputs used.
3. Level 3 rollforward with information about gains/losses and transfers.
4. Sensitivity analysis for Level 3 measurements when changes in inputs would materially affect fair value.

Fair value measurement concepts permeate multiple FAR topics, so practice classifying inputs, computing present values, and prepari
ng disclosure schedules.
