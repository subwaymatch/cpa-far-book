# Fair Value Measurements

Fair value measurement under ASC 820 defines fair value as the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FAR candidates must understand valuation techniques, the fair value hierarchy, and disclosure requirements.

## Fair Value Hierarchy

- **Level 1:** Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (e.g., publicly traded equity securities).
- **Level 2:** Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets, interest rates, yield curves, or market-corroborated inputs.
- **Level 3:** Unobservable inputs reflecting the entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions; often used for complex or illiquid assets.

## Valuation Techniques

- **Market approach:** Uses prices and relevant information from market transactions (e.g., comparable sales).
- **Income approach:** Converts future amounts to a present value using discount rates (e.g., discounted cash flow).
- **Cost approach:** Current replacement cost to replace service capacity of the asset.

Select the technique(s) that maximize observable inputs and minimize unobservable inputs.

## Highest and Best Use

- Applies to nonfinancial assets, considering physically possible, legally permissible, and financially feasible uses.
- For liabilities and an entity’s own equity instruments, fair value assumes the transfer to a market participant of the identical liability or instrument.

## Nonrecurring vs. Recurring Measurements

- **Recurring:** Measured at fair value in each reporting period (e.g., trading securities, derivatives).
- **Nonrecurring:** Measured at fair value only when required by other standards (e.g., impairment testing, asset acquisition).

## Disclosures

1. For each class of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, disclose level within hierarchy.
2. Describe valuation techniques and inputs.
3. Provide Level 3 rollforward including gains/losses, purchases, sales, and transfers.
4. Disclose sensitivity analyses for Level 3 measurements, when applicable.

## IFRS Differences

- IFRS 13 aligns closely with ASC 820; disclosures are similar but may vary in format.

## Exam Tips

- Be comfortable classifying inputs into levels, particularly when multiple inputs exist.
- When both observable and unobservable inputs are used, the classification is based on the lowest significant input.
- Understand how to adjust fair value measurements for nonperformance risk when measuring liabilities.

Fair value measurement concepts appear across numerous topics, making this chapter essential for interpreting valuation-based questions.
