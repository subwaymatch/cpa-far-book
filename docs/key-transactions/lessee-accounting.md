# Lessee Accounting

Lessee accounting under ASC 842 requires recognizing right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for most leases. FAR candidates must classify leases, measure initial balances, and record subsequent expense and cash flows.

## Lease Classification

A lease is a **finance lease** if any of the following criteria are met; otherwise it is an **operating lease**:

1. Ownership transfers to the lessee at the end of the lease.
2. The lessee has a purchase option that is reasonably certain to be exercised.
3. Lease term is for the major part of the asset’s remaining economic life.
4. Present value of lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the asset’s fair value.
5. The asset is specialized with no alternative use to the lessor.

## Initial Measurement

- **Lease liability:** Present value of lease payments (fixed payments, certain variable payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of purchase options, penalties) discounted using implicit rate or incremental borrowing rate.
- **ROU asset:** Lease liability + initial direct costs + prepaid lease payments − lease incentives received.

## Subsequent Measurement

- **Finance leases:** Recognize interest expense on lease liability and amortization of ROU asset (generally straight-line). Liability amortized using effective interest method.
- **Operating leases:** Recognize single lease cost on straight-line basis. Reduce lease liability using effective interest method; adjust ROU asset to achieve straight-line expense.

## Remeasurement and Modifications

- Reassess lease term upon occurrence of significant events within control of lessee (e.g., exercise of option reasonably certain).
- Modifications not accounted for as separate leases require remeasurement of lease liability and adjustment to ROU asset.

## Short-Term and Low-Value Leases

- Leases with terms of 12 months or less and no purchase option may elect an exemption; expense payments on straight-line basis.
- IFRS allows low-value asset exemption (not available under GAAP).

## Presentation and Disclosure

- Finance lease liabilities split between current and noncurrent on balance sheet.
- Finance lease amortization is noncash adjustment in operating activities; principal payments are financing activities. Operating lease payments are operating cash flows.
- Disclose qualitative information, maturity analysis of lease liabilities, weighted-average lease term, and discount rate.

## Exam Tips

- Practice journal entries for initial recognition, subsequent payments, and year-end adjustments.
- Understand how variable lease payments indexed to CPI affect measurement (remeasure when index changes).
- Be prepared to calculate lease classification tests using present value factors.

Lessee accounting questions often require integrating time value of money concepts with presentation and disclosure knowledge.
