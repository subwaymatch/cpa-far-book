# Income Taxes

Accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 requires recognizing current and deferred tax consequences of events recognized in financial statements. FAR candidates must compute tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions.

## Current Tax Expense

- Based on taxable income for the period using enacted tax rates.
- Adjust for tax credits, estimated payments, and prior-year adjustments.

## Deferred Taxes

- Arise from temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
- **Deferred tax liabilities (DTLs):** Taxable temporary differences (e.g., depreciation methods, installment sales).
- **Deferred tax assets (DTAs):** Deductible temporary differences (e.g., warranty liabilities, bad debt allowances) and carryforwards.
- Measure using enacted tax rates expected to apply when differences reverse; do not anticipate future tax law changes.

## Valuation Allowance

- Reduce DTAs with a valuation allowance if it is **more likely than not** that some portion will not be realized.
- Evaluate positive and negative evidence (e.g., cumulative losses, future taxable income projections, tax planning strategies).

## Intraperiod Tax Allocation

- Allocate total tax expense among continuing operations, discontinued operations, OCI items, and items charged directly to equity.
- Follow sequential order: continuing operations first, then others.

## Uncertain Tax Positions

- Apply two-step process: (1) Recognize if more likely than not to be sustained upon examination; (2) Measure largest benefit with cumulative probability > 50%.
- Recognize interest and penalties in income tax expense unless policy states otherwise.

## Interim Reporting

- Use estimated annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date ordinary income.
- Discrete items recognized in the period they occur.

## IFRS Differences

- IAS 12 does not use valuation allowances; instead, recognize DTAs only when probable that taxable profit will be available.
- Recognize deferred taxes on revaluation surplus recognized in OCI.

## Disclosure Requirements

1. Components of income tax expense (current, deferred, federal, state, foreign).
2. Reconciliation of statutory rate to effective tax rate.
3. Significant components of DTAs and DTLs and valuation allowance changes.
4. Unrecognized tax benefits rollforward and associated interest/penalties.

Income tax accounting integrates financial statement analysis with tax law knowledge, making it a challenging yet critical topic on the FAR exam.
