# Income Taxes

Accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 requires recognizing current and deferred tax consequences of events reported in financ
ial statements. FAR candidates must compute tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions.

## Current Tax Provision

- Based on taxable income for the period using enacted tax rates.
- Adjust for tax credits, estimated payments, and prior-year adjustments.

Dr. Income tax expense – current   82,000
    Cr. Income taxes payable             82,000
```

## Deferred Taxes

Temporary differences create deferred tax assets (DTAs) or deferred tax liabilities (DTLs). Measure using enacted tax rates expec
ted when differences reverse.

| Temporary Difference      | Book vs. Tax Treatment                         | Deferred Tax                  | Journal Entry                                               |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Depreciation (tax faster) | Tax depreciation $120,000 vs. book $80,000     | DTL = $40,000 × 25% = $10,000 | `Dr. Income tax expense – deferred 10,000 / Cr. DTL 10,000` |
| Warranty liability        | Book accrues $50,000; tax deductible when paid | DTA = $50,000 × 25% = $12,500 | `Dr. DTA 12,500 / Cr. Income tax expense – deferred 12,500` |

## Valuation Allowance

Reduce DTAs when it is **more likely than not** they will not be realized. Evaluate cumulative losses, future taxable income, and t
ax planning strategies.

Dr. Income tax expense – deferred   6,000
    Cr. Valuation allowance                6,000
```

## Intraperiod Tax Allocation

Allocate total tax expense among continuing operations, discontinued operations, OCI, and items recorded directly in equity. Contin
uing operations is computed first; remaining tax effects are allocated sequentially.

## Uncertain Tax Positions (UTPs)

- Step 1: Recognize tax benefits only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination.
- Step 2: Measure the largest amount of benefit that has a cumulative probability greater than 50% of being sustained.
- Accrue interest and penalties in income tax expense unless policy states otherwise.

Dr. Income tax expense – current   18,000
    Cr. Liability for uncertain tax positions   18,000
```

## Interim Reporting

- Apply the estimated annual effective tax rate (AETR) to year-to-date ordinary income.
- Treat discrete items (e.g., unusual gains, tax law changes) in the period they occur.

## Disclosure Checklist

1. Components of income tax expense (current vs. deferred, federal vs. state).
2. Reconciliation of statutory rate to effective tax rate (percentage or dollar format).
3. Significant components of DTAs and DTLs, including valuation allowance changes.
4. Rollforward of unrecognized tax benefits with amounts that would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.

Income tax accounting integrates financial statement analysis with tax law knowledge, making it a challenging yet critical FAR top
ic.
