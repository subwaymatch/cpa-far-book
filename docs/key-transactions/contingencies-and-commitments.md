# Contingencies and Commitments

Contingencies and commitments create potential future gains or losses. FAR candidates must evaluate probability and estimability to
determine recognition versus disclosure under ASC 450 and related guidance.

## Loss Contingencies

- **Probable and estimable:** Accrue a liability and recognize expense. If a range exists and no amount is better, accrue the minim
um and disclose the range.
- **Reasonably possible:** Disclose nature of contingency and possible loss range.
- **Remote:** Generally no disclosure unless involving guarantees or certain environmental obligations.

### Litigation Example

Company expects to settle a lawsuit for $320,000 with a possible range up to $360,000.

```text
Dr. Litigation expense   320,000
    Cr. Litigation liability   320,000
```

Disclose the possible additional $40,000 exposure.

### Warranty Example

Historical defect rate 2%; current-year sales $5,000,000.

```text
Estimated warranty liability = $5,000,000 × 2% = $100,000
Dr. Warranty expense      100,000
    Cr. Warranty liability     100,000

Actual claim paid:
Dr. Warranty liability     18,000
    Cr. Cash                     18,000
```

## Gain Contingencies

- Do not recognize until realized; disclose when probable and estimable to avoid misleading users.

## Guarantees and Indemnifications (ASC 460)

- Recognize the fair value of a guarantee when issued.

```text
Dr. Guarantee expense    12,000
    Cr. Guarantee liability   12,000
```

Adjust subsequently for losses or release of obligation.

## Purchase and Sales Commitments

- Generally executory; recognize losses when contract price exceeds market price and the entity is obligated to purchase.

```text
Dr. Loss on purchase commitment    45,000
    Cr. Estimated liability on purchase commitment   45,000
```

## Other Commitments

- Disclose long-term purchase agreements, take-or-pay contracts, and capital expenditure commitments.
- Monitor compliance with debt covenants and disclose violations or waivers.

## Exam Tips

- Translate probability language carefully (probable ≈ likely to occur; remote ≈ slight chance).
- For unasserted claims, accrue or disclose only if it is probable that a claim will be asserted and the outcome is reasonably possibl
e.
- Track rollforwards for warranty and litigation liabilities to support financial statement disclosures.

Proper handling of contingencies and commitments prevents understatement of liabilities and informs users about material uncertainti
es.
