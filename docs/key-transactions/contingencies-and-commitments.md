# Contingencies and Commitments

Contingencies and commitments create potential future gains or losses. FAR candidates must evaluate probability and estimability to determine recognition versus disclosure under ASC 450 and other specialized guidance.

## Loss Contingencies

- **Probable and estimable:** Accrue liability and recognize expense. Use best estimate; if a range exists and no amount is better, accrue minimum and disclose range.
- **Reasonably possible:** Disclose nature of contingency and possible loss range.
- **Remote:** No disclosure unless related to guarantees, debt of others, or other exceptions.

Common examples:

- Litigation, claims, and assessments.
- Warranties and product defects (estimate using historical experience or expected value).
- Environmental remediation and asset retirement obligations (see ASC 410).
- Self-insurance programs and premium deficiencies.

## Gain Contingencies

- Do not recognize until realized or virtually assured.
- Disclose when probable to occur, emphasizing nature of contingency.

## Guarantees and Indemnifications

- Recognize liability at fair value when guarantee is issued (ASC 460).
- Examples include standby letters of credit, performance guarantees, and indemnifications in business combinations.

## Purchase and Sales Commitments

- Generally executory and not recognized until performance occurs.
- If losses are expected due to adverse price changes, record estimated loss and liability.

## Commitments

- Disclose long-term purchase commitments, lease commitments, capital expenditure plans, and take-or-pay contracts.
- Monitor compliance with debt covenants and other contractual obligations.

## IFRS Differences

- IAS 37 uses probability threshold of "more likely than not" for provisions (liabilities).
- Best estimate often reflects expected value, especially when a range of outcomes exists.

## Exam Tips

- Carefully read fact patterns for probability language (probable, reasonably possible, remote).
- For warranty problems, compute accrual using expected defect rates; actual claims reduce the liability.
- Evaluate whether unasserted claims require disclosure by considering legal counselâ€™s assessment.

Proper handling of contingencies and commitments ensures liabilities are not understated and users are informed of significant uncertainties.
