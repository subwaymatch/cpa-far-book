# Subsequent Events

Subsequent events are events occurring after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued. FAR candidates must determine whether events require adjustment or disclosure under ASC 855.

## Types of Subsequent Events

- **Recognized events (Type I):** Provide additional evidence about conditions existing at the balance sheet date. Adjust the financial statements (e.g., settlement of litigation confirming liability amount, bankruptcy of a customer indicating receivable impairment).
- **Nonrecognized events (Type II):** Provide evidence about conditions arising after the balance sheet date. Disclose nature and estimated financial effect if material (e.g., fire loss, major business combination, issuance of debt).

## Evaluation Period

- For SEC registrants: from balance sheet date through the date financial statements are issued.
- For non-SEC entities: through the date financial statements are available to be issued. Disclosure of evaluation date required.

## Subsequent Event Procedures

- Review minutes of meetings, inquire of management, obtain legal letters, and evaluate interim financial statements.
- Ensure subsequent events are considered up to the auditorâ€™s report date.

## Reissuance of Financial Statements

- If financial statements are reissued, do not recognize events occurring between the original issuance date and reissuance date unless GAAP requires.
- Subsequent events disclosures should not be updated for the reissuance period, except to correct errors.

## Exam Tips

- Distinguish between **subsequent events** and **subsequent period adjustments** under other standards (e.g., inventory write-down after year-end due to market decline may be Type II).
- Remember to adjust for dividends declared after year-end only if they relate to obligations existing at balance sheet date (e.g., cumulative preferred dividends in arrears are already liabilities).
- Pay attention to wording: "subsequent discovery of fraud" typically requires adjustment and possible restatement.

Proper identification of subsequent events ensures financial statements reflect conditions at the reporting date while disclosing significant future developments.
