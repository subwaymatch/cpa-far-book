# Subsequent Events

Subsequent events occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued. FAR cand
idates must determine whether events require adjustment or disclosure under ASC 855.

## Types of Subsequent Events

- **Recognized events (Type I):** Provide additional evidence about conditions existing at the balance sheet date. Adjust the finan
cial statements.
- **Nonrecognized events (Type II):** Provide evidence about conditions arising after the balance sheet date. Disclose nature and e
stimated financial effect if material.

### Examples

1. **Type I – Receivable Impairment:** Customer declared bankruptcy on January 15; year-end is December 31. Conditions existed at
 year-end, so adjust allowance.

Dr. Allowance for credit losses   45,000
    Cr. Accounts receivable             45,000
```

2. **Type II – Natural Disaster:** Warehouse destroyed by flood on January 20. Disclose nature of loss and insurance coverage; no a
djustment unless carrying amount was impaired at year-end.

3. **Type II – Debt Issuance:** Company issues $5 million in bonds on February 5. Disclose financing arrangement; no adjustment to
12/31 statements.

## Evaluation Period

- SEC registrants evaluate from balance sheet date through the date financial statements are issued.
- Non-SEC entities evaluate through the date financial statements are available to be issued and must disclose that date in the not
es.

## Procedures for Identifying Subsequent Events

- Review board and committee minutes.
- Inquire of management and legal counsel.
- Examine interim financial statements and budgets.
- Confirm subsequent cash receipts for receivables.

## Reissuance Considerations

- When reissuing financial statements, do not recognize events occurring between the original issuance and reissuance dates unless
required to correct an error or provide mandated disclosures.

## Disclosure Checklist

1. Nature of nonrecognized event and estimate of financial effect, or statement that estimate cannot be made.
2. Date through which subsequent events were evaluated and whether financial statements were issued or available to be issued on t
hat date (non-SEC entities).
3. For recognized events, ensure journal entries flow through the statements and related notes (e.g., updated allowance schedules).

Identifying subsequent events accurately ensures statements reflect conditions at the reporting date while informing users about s
ignificant developments before issuance.
