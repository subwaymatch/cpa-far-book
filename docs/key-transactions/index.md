# Key Transactions Overview

This section covers cross-cutting transactions that integrate multiple standards and frequently appear in simulations. Topics inc
lude revenue recognition, leases, fair value measurements, contingencies, subsequent events, income taxes, and accounting changes
.

## Study Approach

- **Understand the underlying model.** Review five-step revenue recognition, lease classification tests, and valuation hierarchy.
- **Practice journal entries.** Task-based simulations often require recording entries or adjusting trial balances for these topic
  s.
- **Connect to financial statements.** Map each transactionâ€™s impact on balance sheet accounts, net income, OCI, and cash flows.
- **Review disclosures.** Many standards require detailed qualitative and quantitative disclosures that may appear as exhibits on
  the exam.
- **Reconcile tax and book effects.** Pay special attention to deferred tax implications, lease liability amortization, and fair v
  alue changes.

Use the detailed chapters to build mastery and apply principles to integrated problems under exam conditions.
