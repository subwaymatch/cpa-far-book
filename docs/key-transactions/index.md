# Key Transactions Overview

This section covers cross-cutting transactions that integrate multiple standards and frequently appear in simulations. Topics include revenue recognition, leases, fair value measurements, contingencies, subsequent events, income taxes, and accounting changes.

## Study Approach

- **Understand the underlying model.** Each transaction type has a conceptual framework (e.g., five-step revenue model, lease classification tests).
- **Practice journal entries.** Simulations often require preparing entries or adjusting trial balances.
- **Connect to financial statements.** Know how each transaction affects balance sheet accounts, net income, OCI, and cash flows.
- **Review disclosures.** Many standards rely on detailed qualitative and quantitative disclosures that can appear as exhibits in exam questions.

Use the detailed chapters to deepen your mastery and apply principles to integrated problems.
