# Revenue Recognition

Revenue recognition under ASC 606 follows a five-step model that applies to nearly all contracts with customers. FAR candidates must be proficient in identifying performance obligations, determining transaction prices, and recognizing revenue when control transfers.

## Five-Step Model

1. **Identify the contract with the customer.** Contracts can be written, oral, or implied; ensure collectibility is probable.
2. **Identify the performance obligations.** Distinct goods or services are separate obligations; consider series guidance for repetitive services.
3. **Determine the transaction price.** Include fixed and variable consideration (subject to constraint), significant financing components, noncash consideration, and consideration payable to the customer.
4. **Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations.** Use relative standalone selling prices; estimate when not directly observable (adjusted market assessment, expected cost plus margin, or residual approach).
5. **Recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied.** Control may transfer over time (input/output methods) or at a point in time.

## Contract Costs

- Capitalize incremental costs of obtaining a contract (e.g., sales commissions) if recoverable, amortize over benefit period.
- Recognize fulfillment costs as assets when they relate directly to a contract, generate or enhance resources, and are expected to be recovered.

## Special Topics

- **Variable consideration:** Use expected value or most likely amount, constrained to avoid significant revenue reversal.
- **Principal vs. agent:** Determine whether the entity controls the good/service before transfer to the customer.
- **Licensing:** Functional intellectual property (e.g., software) is satisfied at a point in time; symbolic IP (e.g., brands) recognized over time.
- **Contract modifications:** Account for as separate contracts, part of existing contracts, or prospective adjustments depending on pricing and distinct goods/services.
- **Nonrefundable upfront fees:** Often represent advance payments for future services; recognize over time.

## Disclosure Requirements

1. Disaggregation of revenue by categories that depict how revenue is affected by economic factors.
2. Contract balances (receivables, contract assets, contract liabilities) and significant changes.
3. Performance obligations, remaining transaction price, and timing of recognition.
4. Significant judgments in applying ASC 606.

## Exam Tips

- Practice identifying performance obligations in multi-element contracts such as telecom, software, or construction.
- Watch for financing components when payments are significantly before or after transfer.
- Understand how contract assets and liabilities roll forward between periods.

Revenue recognition questions often combine conceptual analysis with numerical allocation, so proficiency across the five steps is essential.
