# Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income captures all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. It includes net income and other comprehensive income (OCI), which must be presented in a single continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements.

## Components of Other Comprehensive Income

- **Unrealized gains and losses on debt securities** classified as available-for-sale under ASC 320.
- **Foreign currency translation adjustments** under ASC 830.
- **Gains and losses on derivatives** designated as cash flow hedges (effective portion) under ASC 815.
- **Pension and postretirement benefit adjustments** under ASC 715, including prior service costs and actuarial gains/losses.
- **Changes in credit risk** for liabilities measured at fair value using the fair value option.

## Presentation Choices

1. **Single continuous statement:** Includes net income, components of OCI, and total comprehensive income.
2. **Two-statement approach:** Presents a traditional income statement followed immediately by a statement of comprehensive income starting with net income.

Key requirements:

- Present each component of OCI net of tax or before tax with a tax line item.
- Include reclassification adjustments to avoid double-counting items recognized in both OCI and net income.
- Accumulate OCI in equity as "accumulated other comprehensive income" and reconcile changes in the statement of changes in equity.

## IFRS Differences

- IFRS divides OCI into items that may be reclassified to profit or loss and items that will not be reclassified.
- Revaluation surplus gains under IAS 16 and IAS 38 appear in OCI but are not reclassified to profit or loss.

## Exam Tips

- Memorize the mnemonic "PUFER" (Pension, Unrealized AFS debt securities, Foreign currency, Effective portion of cash flow hedges, Revaluation surplus) to recall OCI components.
- Watch for questions requiring calculation of OCI net of tax. Apply the tax rate to pre-tax amounts to determine the net amount recognized.
- Reclassification adjustments reverse amounts previously recognized in OCI when the related item impacts net income (e.g., sale of an AFS debt security).

Mastery of comprehensive income presentation ensures accuracy in both statement preparation and equity analysis tasks on the exam.
