# Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a period except those from owner investments and distributions. It co
mbines net income and other comprehensive income (OCI) and must be presented either in one continuous statement or in two consec
utive statements under ASC 220.

## Components of Other Comprehensive Income

- Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities (ASC 320).
- Foreign currency translation adjustments for consolidated subsidiaries (ASC 830).
- Effective portion of cash flow hedge gains and losses (ASC 815).
- Pension and postretirement benefit adjustments (ASC 715).
- Changes in instrument-specific credit risk for liabilities measured under the fair value option (ASC 825).

## Example Presentation

Assume a company reports the following during 20X3 (pre-tax amounts):

- Net income: $240,000.
- Unrealized loss on AFS debt securities: $(40,000)$.
- Cash flow hedge gain (effective): $25,000.
- Pension actuarial loss: $(15,000)$.
- Income tax rate: 25%.

Calculate net-of-tax OCI:

| OCI Component | Pre-Tax | Tax (25%) | Net-of-Tax |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AFS loss | (40,000) | 10,000 | (30,000) |
| Cash flow hedge gain | 25,000 | (6,250) | 18,750 |
| Pension loss | (15,000) | 3,750 | (11,250) |
| Total OCI | (30,000) | 7,500 | (22,500) |

Total comprehensive income equals $240,000 + $(22,500)$ = $217,500.

## Journal Entries for OCI Items

    Cr. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt    40,000

Effective cash flow hedge gain:

    Cr. OCI – unrealized loss reclassified      30,000
```

## Disclosure Checklist

1. Total comprehensive income and separate presentation of net income and OCI.
2. Reclassification adjustments for each component of OCI.
3. Tax effects allocated to each OCI component or aggregate tax shown separately.
4. Rollforward of accumulated other comprehensive income in the equity statement.

Understanding comprehensive income ensures that you properly classify OCI entries, reconcile the statement of changes in equity,
and answer FAR simulations involving OCI and EPS interactions.
