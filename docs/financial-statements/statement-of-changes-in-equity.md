# Statement of Changes in Equity

The statement of changes in equity reconciles beginning and ending balances of each equity component—common stock, additional pa
id-in capital (APIC), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), treasury stock, and noncontrolling inter
ests. FAR simulations often require constructing this reconciliation from journal entries.

## Required Elements Under U.S. GAAP

- Opening balances for each equity account.
- Issuances, repurchases, and retirements of equity instruments.
- Dividends declared (cash, stock, or property) and distributions to noncontrolling interests.
- Net income and each component of other comprehensive income.
- Retrospective adjustments from accounting principle changes or error corrections.
- Ending balances tying to the balance sheet.

## Example Reconciliation

Assume the following year-one activity for a corporation (amounts in dollars):

| Equity Component        | Beginning | Activity                                                     | Ending   | Journal Entries                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Common stock ($1 par)   | 100,000   | Issued 10,000 shares at $12                                  | 110,000  | `Dr. Cash 120,000 / Cr. Common stock 10,000 / Cr. APIC 110,000` |
| APIC                    | 250,000   | Share issuance APIC 110,000; treasury stock reissuance 5,000 | 365,000  | `Dr. Cash 30,000 / Cr. Treasury stock 25,000 / Cr. APIC 5,000`  |
| Retained earnings       | 480,000   | Net income 150,000; cash dividends (60,000)                  | 570,000  | `Dr. Retained earnings 60,000 / Cr. Dividends payable 60,000`   |
| AOCI                    | 20,000    | Unrealized gain on AFS debt 8,000                            | 28,000   | `Dr. Debt investment 8,000 / Cr. OCI – unrealized gain 8,000`   |
| Treasury stock (cost)   | (40,000)  | Reissued at $30,000                                          | (10,000) | `Dr. Cash 30,000 / Cr. Treasury stock 25,000 / Cr. APIC 5,000`  |
| Noncontrolling interest | 60,000    | Share of subsidiary earnings 12,000; dividend (4,000)        | 68,000   | `Dr. Dividends payable – NCI 4,000 / Cr. Cash 4,000`            |

The statement displays each column with beginning balance, additions, deductions, and ending balance, ensuring totals reconcile t
o the equity section of the balance sheet.

## Common Transactions and Entries

- **Stock dividends:** Move retained earnings to common stock/APIC at fair value for large dividends (>20–25% recorded at par).
- **Stock splits:** No journal entry; update share counts and par value disclosures.
- **Share-based compensation:** Record compensation expense over vesting period with credit to APIC—stock options.

```text
Dr. Compensation expense   40,000
    Cr. APIC – stock options        40,000
```

- **Treasury stock (cost method):** Record repurchases at cost; reissuance above cost increases APIC; below cost reduces APIC or
  retained earnings.

## Disclosure Checklist

1. Reconciliation of the number of shares authorized, issued, and outstanding for each class.
2. Dividend restrictions or appropriations of retained earnings.
3. Details of accumulated other comprehensive income by component.
4. Changes in noncontrolling interests, including purchases or sales of subsidiary ownership.

Understanding equity rollforwards helps you prepare supporting schedules and ensure the statement of changes in equity ties to a
ll other financial statements and disclosures.
