# Statement of Changes in Equity

The statement of changes in equity reconciles the beginning and ending balances of each equity component, including share capital, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and noncontrolling interests. It highlights transactions with owners and the effects of comprehensive income.

## Required Elements

- **Opening balances** for each equity account.
- **Issuances, repurchases, and retirements** of equity instruments.
- **Dividends declared and paid**, including cash, stock, and property dividends.
- **Comprehensive income** with separate presentation of net income and each OCI component.
- **Changes in accounting policies** or error corrections reflected retrospectively.
- **Noncontrolling interest activity** for consolidated entities.

## Common Transactions

- **Stock dividends and splits:** Stock dividends transfer amounts from retained earnings to paid-in capital; stock splits change share counts without affecting total equity.
- **Share-based compensation:** ASC 718 requires recognition of compensation cost in earnings with corresponding increases to additional paid-in capital.
- **Treasury stock:** Cost method versus par value method. Remember treasury stock transactions never create gains or losses—differences go to APIC or retained earnings.

## IFRS Considerations

- IFRS requires a statement of changes in equity and allows presentation of owner-related changes separately from comprehensive income.
- Revaluation surplus changes under IAS 16 and IAS 38 are included in OCI and accumulated in equity.

## Disclosure Tips

1. Provide reconciliation tables for each class of shares, including number of shares authorized, issued, and outstanding.
2. Describe dividend restrictions, such as retained earnings appropriated for loan covenants.
3. Explain the nature and terms of share-based payment arrangements.
4. Disclose the parent company’s share of subsidiaries’ OCI when noncontrolling interests are present.

Understanding how transactions affect equity equips you to solve simulations dealing with shareholder activity and retained earnings reconciliations.
