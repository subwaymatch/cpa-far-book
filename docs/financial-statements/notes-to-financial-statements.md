# Notes to Financial Statements

Financial statement notes provide context, detail, and disclosure necessary to understand the primary statements. FAR candidates must know the hierarchy of required disclosures and common note content.

## Significant Accounting Policies

- Basis of presentation (GAAP vs. IFRS, fiscal year-end).
- Revenue recognition policies by performance obligation.
- Inventory costing methods, depreciation approaches, and capitalization thresholds.
- Use of estimates and areas subject to significant judgment.

## Common Footnote Areas

1. **Fair value measurements:** Levels within the fair value hierarchy, valuation techniques, and nonrecurring measurements.
2. **Debt and leasing arrangements:** Maturity schedules, interest rates, covenant requirements, and lease commitments.
3. **Income taxes:** Components of deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances, and unrecognized tax benefits.
4. **Contingencies and commitments:** Litigation, guarantees, environmental liabilities, purchase obligations.
5. **Segment reporting:** Operating segments, products, geographic areas, and reconciliations to consolidated totals (ASC 280).
6. **Subsequent events:** Recognized versus nonrecognized events through the issuance date of the financial statements.
7. **Related-party transactions:** Nature of the relationship, terms, and amounts due to/from related parties.

## Interim Reporting Considerations

- Disclosures may be condensed but must include significant changes since the last annual report.
- Provide updates on contingencies, changes in accounting estimates, and subsequent events.

## IFRS Differences

- IFRS requires disclosure of key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments separately.
- Emphasizes capital management objectives and policies.

## Exam Tips

- Carefully read footnote excerpts provided in task-based simulations; they often contain necessary assumptions for calculations.
- Remember that some disclosures (e.g., concentrations of credit risk under ASC 825) are required even when the risk is remote.
- When evaluating subsequent events, identify the date through which management evaluated events and whether the financial statements have been issued or are available to be issued.

Effective note disclosures enhance transparency and inform decision-making for users of financial statements.
