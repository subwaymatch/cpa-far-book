## Exam Tips

- Identify whether notes reflect issued or available-to-be-issued financial statements for subsequent event evaluation.
- Watch for concentration disclosures under ASC 825 and ASC 275 (e.g., major customers, suppliers, geographic risks).
- Tie note balances back to the primary statements to ensure completeness when building schedules.

Strong familiarity with note content allows you to interpret simulation exhibits quickly and craft accurate memo responses on the
exam.
