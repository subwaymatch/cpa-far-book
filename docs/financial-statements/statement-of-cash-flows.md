# Statement of Cash Flows

The statement of cash flows reconciles beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents by detailing operating, investing, and fin
ancing activities. ASC 230 governs U.S. GAAP requirements, making the statement a staple of CPA FAR simulations.

## Presentation Methods

- **Indirect method (common on the exam):** Starts with net income and adjusts for noncash items and changes in working capital.
- **Direct method:** Shows gross cash receipts and payments (cash received from customers, cash paid to suppliers, etc.). GAAP re
quires a reconciliation to net income when using this method.

## Operating Activities

Operating activities convert accrual-basis net income to cash from operations. Key adjustments include:

- Add back noncash expenses (depreciation, amortization, impairment).
- Remove nonoperating gains and losses recorded in net income (e.g., gain on equipment sale) and classify related cash in investi
ng or financing.
- Adjust for working-capital changes: increases in current assets are subtractions; increases in current liabilities are addition
s.

### Journal Entry Tie-In

Depreciation expense recognized during the period:

```text
Dr. Depreciation expense   25,000
    Cr. Accumulated depreciation     25,000
```

The entry has no cash effect. Under the indirect method, add $25,000 back to net income.

## Investing Activities

Investing activities relate to long-term assets and certain investments:

- Purchases and sales of property, plant, and equipment.
- Purchases and maturities or sales of debt and equity securities not classified as cash equivalents.
- Cash paid to acquire businesses, and cash received from divesting components.

**Example:** Equipment with a cost of $120,000 and accumulated depreciation of $80,000 is sold for $35,000.

```text
Dr. Cash                     35,000
Dr. Accumulated depreciation 80,000
    Cr. Equipment                      120,000
    Cr. Gain on sale of equipment        5,000
```

Investing cash inflow is $35,000. The $5,000 gain is removed from net income in the operating section.

## Financing Activities

Financing activities involve the entity's capital structure:

- Issuing common stock, preferred stock, or debt.
- Repaying principal on borrowings and redeeming stock.
- Paying dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests.

**Example:** Company issues bonds at par for $500,000 and later pays $20,000 of dividends.

```text
Issuance:
Dr. Cash             500,000
    Cr. Bonds payable           500,000

Dividend declaration and payment:
Dr. Retained earnings   20,000
    Cr. Dividends payable       20,000

Dr. Dividends payable   20,000
    Cr. Cash                    20,000
```

The bond issuance is a $500,000 financing inflow; the dividend payment is a $20,000 financing outflow.

## Noncash Investing and Financing Activities

Disclose significant noncash transactions in a supplemental schedule or footnote, such as:

- Acquiring equipment through a finance lease.
- Converting debt to equity.
- Exchanging noncash assets.

The journal entry for entering a finance lease emphasizes the noncash nature:

```text
Dr. Right-of-use asset  250,000
    Cr. Lease liability          250,000
```

## Preparation Steps for the Exam

1. Identify net income from the income statement.
2. Adjust for noncash items and working-capital changes (indirect method).
3. Analyze comparative balance sheets and supporting data for investing and financing cash flows.
4. Isolate and disclose noncash transactions.
5. Tie ending cash to the balance sheet and reconcile with beginning cash.

Mastery of these steps equips you to build cash flow statements quickly, interpret liquidity, and answer simulation prompts that
require classification of cash and noncash transactions.
