# Statement of Cash Flows

The statement of cash flows explains changes in cash and cash equivalents by classifying cash inflows and outflows as operating, investing, or financing activities. ASC 230 sets GAAP requirements; IFRS IAS 7 provides similar guidance with notable classification differences.

## Presentation Methods

- **Indirect method (most common):** Starts with net income and adjusts for noncash items and changes in working capital to derive net cash from operating activities.
- **Direct method:** Presents major classes of gross cash receipts and payments (e.g., cash received from customers). GAAP requires a reconciliation to net income when using the direct method.

## Operating Activities

- Cash receipts from customers and interest/dividends received (GAAP).
- Cash payments to suppliers, employees, interest, and taxes.
- Adjustments for depreciation, amortization, gains/losses, deferred taxes, and changes in current assets/liabilities.

## Investing Activities

- Purchases and sales of property, plant, and equipment.
- Purchases and maturities/sales of debt and equity securities not classified as cash equivalents.
- Loans made to others and collections on those loans.

## Financing Activities

- Proceeds from issuing debt or equity.
- Repayments of principal (excluding interest) and reacquisition of stock.
- Dividends paid to shareholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests.

## Noncash Transactions

Material noncash investing and financing activities (e.g., acquiring equipment via capital lease, converting debt to equity) must be disclosed, typically in supplemental schedules.

## IFRS Classification Differences

- Interest paid and received, and dividends received may be classified as operating or financing/investing under IFRS with consistent policy application.
- Dividends paid may be operating or financing.
- Bank overdrafts repayable on demand can be included in cash and cash equivalents.

## Exam Tips

- Memorize common adjustments for the indirect method (e.g., add back depreciation, subtract increases in current assets).
- Watch for classification traps such as trading securities (operating) versus available-for-sale securities (investing).
- Pay attention to income tax effects when classifying cash flows arising from investing or financing activities.

Proficiency with the statement of cash flows enables you to convert accrual-based information into cash metrics and respond to simulations requiring reconciliation schedules.
