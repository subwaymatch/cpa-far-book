# Financial Statements Overview

This part of the FAR textbook explains the primary financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP and IFRS, their required components, and the analytical tools that users rely on to interpret results. Mastering the presentation rules provides a framework for the transaction-specific topics covered later in the book.

## Core Statements Covered

- **Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet):** Classification of assets and liabilities, measurement bases, and disclosure requirements.
- **Statement of Earnings (Income Statement):** Revenue and expense recognition, nonrecurring items, and earnings per share.
- **Statement of Comprehensive Income:** Reporting of other comprehensive income components and presentation alternatives.
- **Statement of Changes in Equity:** Reconciliation of beginning and ending equity balances, including capital transactions and OCI reclassifications.
- **Statement of Cash Flows:** Operating, investing, and financing cash flow classification, direct versus indirect method, and noncash disclosures.
- **Notes to the Financial Statements:** Significant accounting policies, estimates, and required supplementary information.
