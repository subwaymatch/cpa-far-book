# Balance Sheet

The balance sheet (statement of financial position) reports an entity's assets, liabilities, and equity at a point in time. FAR candidates must understand classification, measurement bases, and required disclosures under ASC 210, ASC 305, and related standards.

## Classification Principles

- **Current vs. noncurrent:** Current assets are expected to be realized or consumed within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. Current liabilities are obligations due within the same period.
- **Order of liquidity:** GAAP allows listing assets in order of liquidity for financial institutions; most other entities present current assets first.
- **Offsetting:** Offsetting assets and liabilities is prohibited unless permitted by GAAP (e.g., derivative master netting agreements, right of setoff).

## Required Line Items

- Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash disclosures.
- Receivables with allowance accounts presented separately.
- Inventories classified by valuation method if material.
- Property, plant, and equipment net of accumulated depreciation.
- Intangible assets and goodwill with impairment considerations.
- Current and long-term portions of debt, including maturities.
- Accrued expenses, contingencies, and deferred tax assets/liabilities.

## Measurement Considerations

- **Historical cost** remains the default for most nonfinancial assets.
- **Fair value** is required for certain financial instruments under ASC 825 election or ASC 320 debt securities.
- **Lower of cost or net realizable value** applies to inventory and certain receivables.

## Presentation Under IFRS

- Terminology differs ("statement of financial position").
- IFRS requires a minimum of two statements of financial position (current period and prior period) when an accounting policy change has retrospective effect.
- Classification is similar but allows presentation by liquidity for all entities when relevant.

## Disclosure Checklist

1. **Accounting policies** for significant asset and liability classes.
2. **Contingent liabilities** with probability and estimable ranges.
3. **Maturity schedules** for long-term debt and lease obligations.
4. **Collateralization** and restrictions on assets.
5. **Subsequent events** that materially affect financial position.

A clear, well-organized balance sheet supports ratio analysis and provides the foundation for stakeholders evaluating liquidity and solvency.
