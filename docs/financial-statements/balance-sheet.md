# Balance Sheet

The balance sheet (statement of financial position) presents assets, liabilities, and equity at a point in time. FAR candidates
must know classification rules, measurement bases, and how transactions flow into ending balances under U.S. GAAP.

## Classification Principles

- **Current versus noncurrent:** Current assets will be realized or consumed within one year or the operating cycle, whichever i
s longer. Current liabilities are obligations due within the same timeframe. Present current and noncurrent subtotals.
- **Order of presentation:** Most entities list current assets in order of liquidity (cash, receivables, inventory). Financial i
stitutions may present assets in order of liquidity.
- **Offsetting:** Offset assets and liabilities only when permitted (e.g., derivative master netting agreements, right of setoff
 for certain receivables/payables).
- **Retained earnings and AOCI:** Present as separate equity components, reconcilable to the statement of changes in equity.

## Key Line Items and Typical Adjustments

| Line Item | Measurement | Example Adjusting Entry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accounts receivable (net) | Gross receivables less allowance for credit losses | `Dr. Bad debt expense 4,000 / Cr. Allowance for credit losses 4,000` |
| Inventory | Lower of cost or net realizable value (FIFO, weighted average) | `Dr. Loss on inventory write-down 6,500 / Cr. Inventory 6,500` |
| Property, plant, and equipment | Historical cost less accumulated depreciation | `Dr. Depreciation expense 30,000 / Cr. Accumulated depreciation 30,000` |
| Current portion of long-term debt | Reclassify principal due within 12 months | `Dr. Long-term debt 50,000 / Cr. Current portion of LTD 50,000` |
| Accrued expenses | Estimate of obligations incurred but unpaid | `Dr. Wage expense 18,000 / Cr. Wages payable 18,000` |

## Example: Year-End Adjustments

A retailer reviews its December 31 balances:

- Receivables total $150,000; an aging schedule indicates $5,000 is uncollectible.
- Inventory cost is $200,000; current selling price less costs to complete is $198,000.
- Bank loan of $250,000 requires $40,000 principal repayment next March.

Dr. Bad debt expense           5,000
    Cr. Allowance for credit losses      5,000

Dr. Loss on inventory write-down 2,000
    Cr. Inventory                         2,000

Dr. Long-term debt             40,000
    Cr. Current portion of long-term debt 40,000
```

The net receivable becomes $145,000, inventory becomes $198,000, and liabilities now show $40,000 current and $210,000 long-term
.

## Disclosure Checklist

1. Significant accounting policies for major asset and liability classes.
2. Restrictions on cash, compensating balances, or collateralized assets.
3. Maturity schedules for long-term debt and lease obligations.
4. Details of contingencies and guarantees under ASC 450 and ASC 460.
5. Subsequent events that materially affect financial position.

A well-organized balance sheet supports liquidity and solvency analysis and feeds directly into ratio calculations frequently te
sted on the FAR exam.
