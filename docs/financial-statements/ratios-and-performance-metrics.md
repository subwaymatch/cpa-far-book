# Ratios and Performance Metrics

Financial statement analysis relies on ratios that evaluate liquidity, solvency, profitability, and efficiency. FAR questions of
ten provide trial balances or financial statements and require quick computation and interpretation of these metrics.

## Liquidity Ratios

| Ratio | Formula | Interpretation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current ratio | Current assets ÷ current liabilities | Ability to meet short-term obligations | If current assets = $420,000 and current liabilities = $300,000, current ratio = 1.4. |
| Quick ratio | (Cash + marketable securities + net receivables) ÷ current liabilities | Stringent liquidity excluding inventory | Cash $80,000 + securities $40,000 + receivables $110,000 = $230,000; ÷ $300,000 = 0.77. |
| Cash conversion cycle | DSO + DIO − DPO | Time between paying suppliers and collecting cash | DSO 40 + DIO 55 − DPO 32 = 63 days. |

## Solvency Ratios

- **Debt-to-equity:** Total liabilities ÷ total equity. Example: $900,000 ÷ $600,000 = 1.5.
- **Times interest earned:** Earnings before interest and taxes ÷ interest expense. Example: $250,000 EBIT ÷ $50,000 interest = 5.
- **Debt service coverage:** Operating income ÷ (principal + interest payments). Use to assess covenant compliance.

## Profitability Ratios

| Ratio | Formula | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gross margin | Gross profit ÷ net sales | Gross profit $360,000 ÷ sales $1,000,000 = 36%. |
| Operating margin | Operating income ÷ net sales | Operating income $210,000 ÷ $1,000,000 = 21%. |
| Return on assets | Net income ÷ average total assets | Net income $140,000 ÷ average assets $1,200,000 = 11.7%. |
| Return on equity | (Net income − preferred dividends) ÷ average common equity | ($140,000 − $10,000) ÷ $750,000 = 17.3%. |

## Efficiency Ratios

- **Inventory turnover:** Cost of goods sold ÷ average inventory. Example: $620,000 ÷ $155,000 = 4.0 turns; days inventory = 365 ÷ 4 = 91.3 days.
- **Receivables turnover:** Net credit sales ÷ average accounts receivable. Example: $1,000,000 ÷ $120,000 = 8.3 turns; DSO = 365 ÷ 8.3 ≈ 44 days.
- **Asset turnover:** Net sales ÷ average total assets. Highlights productivity of asset base.

## Linking Ratios to Journal Entries

Ratios respond to underlying entries. For instance, writing off an uncollectible account affects turnover and liquidity:

```text
Dr. Allowance for credit losses   6,000
    Cr. Accounts receivable              6,000
```

The write-off reduces receivables and impacts the quick ratio and DSO. Similarly, financing transactions alter leverage metrics:

```text
Dr. Cash             400,000
    Cr. Long-term debt     400,000
```

## Analytical Considerations

1. Use averages of beginning and ending balances unless the problem specifies otherwise.
2. Adjust ratios for significant nonrecurring items (e.g., restructuring charges) to understand core performance.
3. Reconcile changes in ratios to operational drivers—price changes, volume, cost structure, and capital deployment.
4. Compare ratios to industry benchmarks and prior periods to identify strengths and weaknesses.

Practicing ratio calculations and connecting them to journal entries enhances your ability to interpret financial statements and
craft succinct explanations on exam simulations.
