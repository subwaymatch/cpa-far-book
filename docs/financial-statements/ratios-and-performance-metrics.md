# Ratios and Performance Metrics

Financial statement analysis relies on ratios and performance measures that provide insight into liquidity, solvency, profitability, and efficiency. FAR problems frequently require calculating or interpreting these metrics using provided financial statements.

## Liquidity Ratios

- **Current ratio:** Current assets ÷ current liabilities. Measures short-term debt-paying ability.
- **Quick ratio (acid-test):** (Cash + marketable securities + net receivables) ÷ current liabilities.
- **Cash conversion cycle:** Days sales outstanding + days inventory outstanding − days payable outstanding.

## Solvency Ratios

- **Debt to equity:** Total liabilities ÷ total equity.
- **Times interest earned:** (Income before interest and taxes) ÷ interest expense.
- **Debt service coverage:** Operating income ÷ (principal + interest payments).

## Profitability Ratios

- **Gross margin:** Gross profit ÷ net sales.
- **Operating margin:** Operating income ÷ net sales.
- **Return on assets (ROA):** Net income ÷ average total assets.
- **Return on equity (ROE):** Net income ÷ average shareholders' equity. Adjust for preferred dividends when focusing on common shareholders.

## Efficiency Ratios

- **Inventory turnover:** Cost of goods sold ÷ average inventory.
- **Receivables turnover:** Net credit sales ÷ average accounts receivable.
- **Asset turnover:** Net sales ÷ average total assets.

## Market-Based Metrics (Public Companies)

- **Earnings per share (EPS):** Basic and diluted calculations per ASC 260.
- **Price-earnings (P/E) ratio:** Market price per share ÷ EPS.
- **Dividend payout ratio:** Dividends per share ÷ EPS.

## Analytical Considerations

- Use averages of beginning and ending balances when ratios reference "average" amounts unless specified otherwise.
- Compare ratios to industry benchmarks and prior periods to identify trends.
- Understand how accounting policy choices (e.g., LIFO vs. FIFO) affect ratios.
- When evaluating solvency, incorporate off-balance-sheet obligations such as operating leases or guarantees disclosed in notes.

Practicing ratio calculations enhances your ability to interpret financial statements quickly and respond to exam questions requiring both computation and analysis.
