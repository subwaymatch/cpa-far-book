# Income Statement

The income statement (statement of earnings) reports the profitability of an entity for a period. FAR candidates must connect re
cognition guidance to presentation requirements and know how results flow to EPS and retained earnings.

## Multi-Step Structure

| Subtotal | Typical Formula | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Net sales | Gross sales − sales returns and allowances | Present separately if material. |
| Gross profit | Net sales − cost of goods sold | Inventory accounting method drives COGS. |
| Operating income | Gross profit − operating expenses | Segregate selling, general, and administrative costs. |
| Income from continuing operations | Operating income ± other gains/losses − income tax expense | Includes interest, equity method income, and restructuring charges. |
| Net income | Income from continuing operations ± discontinued operations (net of tax) | Noncontrolling interest shown for consolidated entities. |

Public companies must follow Regulation S-X, but the same format is preferred for private-company clarity. Always present discon
tinued operations net of tax below income from continuing operations once a component is held for sale and meets the guidance in
 ASC 205-20.

## Recognition Principles

- Recognize revenue when performance obligations are satisfied under ASC 606.
- Recognize expenses using matching concepts: direct association, systematic allocation (e.g., depreciation), or as incurred.
- Report gains and losses from derecognition of assets at the date control transfers.
- Present unusual or infrequent items within income from continuing operations with descriptive captions.
- Report changes in accounting principles retrospectively with a cumulative effect to beginning retained earnings, not as a curre
nt-period income statement item.

## Example: Recording Revenue and Expenses

A manufacturer sells equipment for $120,000 with $10,000 expected returns. COGS is $70,000. During the period it incurs $20,000
in selling expenses and $15,000 in administrative expenses. The journal entries include:

```text
Dr. Accounts receivable      120,000
    Cr. Sales revenue                     120,000

Dr. Sales returns and allowances 10,000
    Cr. Refund liability                  10,000

Dr. Cost of goods sold         70,000
    Cr. Inventory                          70,000

Dr. Selling expense            20,000
Dr. Administrative expense     15,000
    Cr. Cash                                  35,000
```

Gross profit equals $120,000 − $10,000 − $70,000 = $40,000. Operating income is $40,000 − $20,000 − $15,000 = $5,000.

## Earnings Per Share Considerations

- Present basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for income from continuing operations and net income.
- Weighted-average shares outstanding adjust for stock dividends and splits retroactively.
- Diluted EPS considers convertible instruments, options, and warrants using the if-converted and treasury stock methods.

## Disclosure Checklist

1. Major revenue categories and significant judgments per ASC 606.
2. Composition of other income and other expense lines.
3. Details of restructuring, litigation, and impairment charges.
4. Tax rate reconciliation and significant deferred tax components if not disclosed elsewhere.
5. Schedule reconciling income taxes from continuing operations to total tax expense when discontinued operations exist.

Thorough understanding of income statement mechanics supports answering simulations that require adjusting entries, constructing
subtotals, and interpreting performance metrics.
