# Income Statement

The income statement (statement of earnings) measures performance over a reporting period. FAR candidates should know presentation formats, revenue and expense classification, and special reporting items.

## Presentation Formats

- **Single-step:** Groups all revenues and gains together, subtracts total expenses and losses to derive net income. Simple but less detail on operating vs. nonoperating results.
- **Multi-step:** Presents gross profit, operating income, and other key subtotals. Required for public companies under Regulation S-X.
- **Condensed statements:** Interim financial statements may present condensed formats with reference to notes for detail.

## Revenue and Expense Recognition

- Recognize revenue when control transfers under ASC 606's five-step model.
- Match expenses to related revenues (matching principle) or as incurred if no direct link exists.
- Classify discontinued operations separately net of tax after considering held-for-sale criteria under ASC 205-20.

## Special Items

- **Unusual or infrequent items** are reported as part of income from continuing operations but should be disclosed separately.
- **Extraordinary items** no longer exist under GAAP but may still appear in legacy questionsâ€”remember they were both unusual and infrequent, net of tax.
- **Changes in accounting principle** are reflected retrospectively with cumulative adjustments to beginning retained earnings.
- **Earnings per share (EPS)**: Basic and diluted EPS must be presented for income from continuing operations and net income on the face of the statement for public entities.

## IFRS Differences

- Terminology includes "statement of profit or loss."
- IFRS prohibits presenting extraordinary items.
- Expenses can be classified by nature (e.g., depreciation) or by function (e.g., cost of sales); whichever method is chosen must be disclosed consistently.

## Disclosure Highlights

1. Revenue disaggregation consistent with ASC 606 disclosures.
2. Major customers and segments when reporting under ASC 280.
3. Components of other income/expense, including gains and losses from foreign currency transactions.
4. Subsequent events that materially affect earnings.

Understanding income statement presentation is crucial for analyzing profitability and responding to simulation prompts requiring multi-step formatting.
