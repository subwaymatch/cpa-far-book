# Skill Allocation

FAR assesses more than factual recall. The AICPA blueprint aligns each content area with cognitive skill levels that reflect the complexity of tasks expected of entry-level CPAs.

## Cognitive Skill Levels

| Skill Level | Description | FAR Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Remembering and Understanding | Demonstrate comprehension of concepts, definitions, and terminology. | Tested primarily through foundational MCQs. |
| Application | Use knowledge to perform calculations, journal entries, and straightforward analysis. | Dominant skill in both MCQs and TBSs. |
| Analysis | Examine relationships, interpret data, and identify the best response among alternatives. | Frequently assessed in simulations and integrated problems. |
| Evaluation | Make judgments, support conclusions, or determine compliance with standards. | Less common but appears in advanced simulations, especially consolidations and governmental reporting. |

## Study Tips by Skill Level

- **Remembering and Understanding:** Create summary sheets and flashcards for definitions (e.g., components of OCI, fund types). Recite key mnemonics like "SCARE" for pension components.
- **Application:** Work timed problem sets that require journal entries and classification (e.g., lease amortization schedules, inventory costing).
- **Analysis:** Deconstruct multi-step problems by identifying what is being asked, which standards apply, and which data is relevant. Practice with case-study-style TBSs.
- **Evaluation:** Review authoritative literature to support conclusions. Practice writing responses that reference codification citations or governmental GASB paragraphs when required.

## Practice Strategy

1. **Blend question types.** After learning a topic, attempt both MCQs and TBSs to build endurance switching between skill levels.
2. **Reflect after each session.** Document mistakes and identify whether they stemmed from conceptual gaps or misreading the question.
3. **Simulate exam conditions weekly.** Full-length practice tests highlight pacing and skill transitions under time pressure.

Recognizing the skills tested guides how you practice and helps ensure you can demonstrate competence beyond rote memorization.
