# Skill Allocation

FAR assesses more than factual recall. The AICPA blueprint aligns each content area with cognitive skill levels that mirror tasks e
xpected of entry-level CPAs.

## Cognitive Skill Levels

| Skill Level                   | Description                                                                               | FAR Emphasis                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Remembering and Understanding | Demonstrate comprehension of concepts, definitions, and terminology.                      | Frequently tested through foundational MCQs and warm-up tabs in simulations.                                    |
| Application                   | Use knowledge to perform calculations, journal entries, and straightforward analysis.     | Dominant skill in both MCQs and TBSs; think depreciation schedules, bond amortization, and revenue recognition. |
| Analysis                      | Examine relationships, interpret data, and identify the best response among alternatives. | Common in simulations that require reconciling exhibits or evaluating variances.                                |
| Evaluation                    | Make judgments, support conclusions, or determine compliance with standards.              | Appears in advanced simulations, research tasks, and governmental conversions.                                  |

## Study Tips by Skill Level

- **Remembering and Understanding:** Build summary sheets, flashcards, and quick-reference tables for fund types, OCI components,
  and ASC references. Recite mnemonics aloud to reinforce memory pathways.
- **Application:** Work timed problem sets that require journal entries, amortization schedules, and classification decisions. Doc
  ument each journal entry in a template to reinforce debits and credits.
- **Analysis:** Practice multi-step case studies. Break problems into inputs, processing, and outputs before computing results. Us
  e highlight tools to mark relevant data in exhibits.
- **Evaluation:** Complete authoritative research exercises. Write short memos referencing codification paragraphs to support concl
  usions.

## Practice Strategy

1. **Blend question types.** After learning a topic, tackle MCQs for recall/application and simulations for analysis/evaluation.
2. **Track error patterns.** Note whether mistakes stem from concept gaps, misreading, or calculator slips; adjust study tactics ac
   cordingly.
3. **Simulate exam conditions weekly.** Schedule full-length practice sessions to test pacing and mental stamina.
4. **Review journal entries verbally.** Explaining why each entry is recorded reinforces higher-order understanding.

Skill-focused practice ensures you can perform under exam conditions, not just memorize content.
