# Exam Overview and Structure

The FAR section is a four-hour computer-based examination that blends multiple-choice questions (MCQs), task-based simulations (TBSs), and pretest items used for future exam development. Understanding the structure helps you allocate time and stamina during your exam appointment.

## Testlets and Weighting

| Component | Quantity | Weight | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Multiple-Choice Questions | 50 scored (plus 12 pretest) | 50% | Two MCQ testlets with adaptive difficulty. |
| Task-Based Simulations | 7 scored (plus 1 pretest) | 50% | Three TBS testlets emphasizing application and analysis skills. |

- **Adaptive MCQ delivery.** The second multiple-choice testlet adjusts difficulty based on your performance on the first. Difficulty does not change scoring potential—harder questions simply contain more distractors and require more precision.
- **Authoritative literature access.** During TBS testlets you can search the FASB Codification, GASB Codification, and AICPA Professional Standards as applicable. Practice researching efficiently.

## Time Management Strategy

1. **Plan on 120 minutes for MCQs.** Target about 1 minute per question on the first testlet and adjust for difficulty on the second.
2. **Reserve 120 minutes for simulations.** Allocate roughly 15–18 minutes per scored TBS, leaving time to research and review.
3. **Use the optional 15-minute break.** AICPA provides breaks after the third testlet without impacting the exam clock.

## Scoring Considerations

- The exam is scaled on a 0–99 scale; 75 is passing. Each question contributes differently based on difficulty and skill level assessed.
- Pretest items are indistinguishable from scored items, so give every question your best effort.
- TBSs commonly evaluate journal entries, financial statement tie-outs, and adjustments. Partial credit is awarded when portions of a response are correct.

## Key Exam Policies

- **No backward navigation.** Once you exit a testlet, you cannot return to it.
- **Calculator and spreadsheet tools** are provided within the exam interface—practice using the on-screen spreadsheet to reduce mechanical errors.
- **Accommodations and scheduling** are managed through NASBA and Prometric; schedule early to secure your desired testing window.

Knowing the structure reduces anxiety on exam day and allows you to approach each testlet with a proven pacing strategy.
