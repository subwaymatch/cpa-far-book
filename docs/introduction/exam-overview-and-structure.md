# Exam Overview and Structure

The FAR section is a four-hour computer-based examination containing multiple-choice questions (MCQs), task-based simulations (TB
Ss), and pretest items used for future exam development. Understanding the structure helps you allocate time and manage stamina.

## Testlets and Weighting

| Component                 | Quantity                    | Weight | Notes                                                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multiple-Choice Questions | 50 scored (plus 12 pretest) | 50%    | Two MCQ testlets with adaptive difficulty.               |
| Task-Based Simulations    | 7 scored (plus 1 pretest)   | 50%    | Three TBS testlets emphasizing application and analysis. |

- **Adaptive MCQ delivery:** The second MCQ testlet adjusts difficulty based on performance in the first. Harder testlets may con
  tain more distractors but offer the same scoring potential.
- **Authoritative literature access:** During TBS testlets you can search the FASB Codification, GASB Codification, and AICPA Pro
  fessional Standards. Practice keyword strategies before exam day.

## Time Management Strategy

1. **120 minutes for MCQs.** Target about one minute per item on the first testlet and adjust based on difficulty in the second.
2. **120 minutes for simulations.** Allocate roughly 15–18 minutes per scored TBS, allowing extra time for research and review.
3. **Use the optional 15-minute break** after the third testlet. The timer stops, so step away and reset mentally.

### Example Simulation Plan

- Research or written communication TBS: 10–12 minutes.
- Journal entry or financial statement tie-out TBS: 18 minutes each.
- Multi-tab case involving ratios or consolidation: 20 minutes. Prioritize high-point tabs first and leave review time at the end.

## Scoring Considerations

- FAR is scaled 0–99 with 75 required to pass. Each question’s contribution depends on difficulty and skill level assessed.
- Pretest items are indistinguishable from scored items—treat every item seriously.
- TBSs award partial credit for correct table cells, journal entries, and calculations. Even partial responses can raise your score
  .

## Key Exam Policies

- **No backward navigation:** Once you exit a testlet, you cannot return to it.
- **On-screen spreadsheet and calculator:** Practice with the exam tools to minimize mechanical errors on test day.
- **Identification and breaks:** Bring required IDs and follow Prometric procedures. Return promptly from the optional break to a
  void rushing the final testlets.

Knowing the structure reduces anxiety and allows you to approach each testlet with a deliberate pacing strategy.
