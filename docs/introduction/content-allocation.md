# Content Allocation

The AICPA blueprint outlines the percentage weight assigned to major content groups on the FAR exam. Aligning your study schedule with these weightings ensures you invest time proportional to what is tested.

## FAR Blueprint Areas

| Blueprint Area | Approximate Weight | Representative Topics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Area I — Conceptual Framework, Standard-Setting, and Financial Reporting | 25–35% | Financial statements, reporting framework, SEC filings, ratio analysis |
| Area II — Select Financial Statement Accounts | 30–40% | Assets, liabilities, equity, revenue recognition, expenses |
| Area III — Select Transactions | 20–30% | Leases, derivatives, hedging, income taxes, business combinations |
| Area IV — State and Local Governments | 5–15% | Governmental financial reporting, funds, budgets |

### Study Implications

- **Focus on Areas I and II early.** These areas represent the largest exam share and underpin more complex topics.
- **Spiral review for Area III.** Transactions like leases and pensions require repeated practice with journal entries and classification.
- **Maintain consistent exposure to governmental accounting.** Despite a lower percentage, the specialized terminology makes last-minute cramming risky.

## Topic Prioritization Checklist

1. **Review blueprint updates quarterly.** The AICPA publishes revisions reflecting new standards, including effective dates for public and nonpublic entities.
2. **Track your proficiency.** Use a study planner to allocate more time to weak areas while ensuring periodic reinforcement of strengths.
3. **Integrate MCQ sets by blueprint area.** This helps mimic the mixed-topic nature of the actual exam and exposes you to the range of question difficulty.

Aligning preparation with the blueprint ensures you cover the breadth of FAR while giving deliberate attention to high-weight areas.
