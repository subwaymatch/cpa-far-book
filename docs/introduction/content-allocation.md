# Content Allocation

The AICPA blueprint assigns percentage weightings to major FAR content groups. Aligning your study schedule with these weights en
sures you invest time proportional to what is tested.

## FAR Blueprint Areas

| Blueprint Area | Approximate Weight | Representative Topics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Area I — Conceptual Framework, Standard-Setting, and Financial Reporting | 25–35% | Financial statements, reporting framework, SEC filings, ratio analysis |
| Area II — Select Financial Statement Accounts | 30–40% | Cash, receivables, inventory, PP&E, intangible assets, liabilities, equity |
| Area III — Select Transactions | 20–30% | Revenue recognition, leases, derivatives, hedging, income taxes, business combinations |
| Area IV — State and Local Governments | 5–15% | Fund accounting, budgetary reporting, government-wide statements |

## Study Implications

- **Start with Areas I and II.** They carry the most weight and provide the foundation for transaction-specific questions.
- **Spiral review Area III topics.** Leases, pensions, and fair value measurements require repeated practice with journal entries
and classification drills.
- **Schedule weekly governmental practice.** The terminology and fund structures are unique; consistent exposure prevents last-mi
nute cramming.

### Sample Eight-Week Plan

| Week | Focus | Key Activities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1–2 | Area I foundations | Read financial statement chapters, complete MCQs on presentation and conceptual framework. |
| 3–4 | Area II assets | Work problems on inventory, PP&E, and receivables; prepare adjusting entries and rollforwards. |
| 5 | Area II liabilities and equity | Drill debt amortization schedules, contingencies, and equity transactions. |
| 6 | Area III transactions | Alternate days between revenue, leases, income taxes, and business combinations with simulation practice. |
| 7 | Area IV governmentals | Build fund-based journal entries and conversion worksheets; take targeted MCQ sets. |
| 8 | Comprehensive review | Mix-topic practice exams, rework weak areas, and complete simulated exam sessions. |

## Topic Prioritization Checklist

1. Review blueprint updates quarterly for new standards and effective dates.
2. Track proficiency scores by content area to guide adaptive review.
3. Integrate MCQ sets by blueprint area to mimic the mixed-topic nature of the exam.
4. Allocate simulation practice proportionally—roughly half of weekly study time should involve TBSs once fundamentals are in pla
ce.

Blueprint-driven planning keeps your preparation focused on the topics most likely to appear on exam day.
